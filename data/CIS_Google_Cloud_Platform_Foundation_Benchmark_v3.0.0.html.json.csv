Shielded VM offers verifiable integrity of your Compute Engine VM instances, so you can be confident your instances haven't been compromised by boot- or kernel-level malware or rootkits.

Integrity monitoring helps you understand and make decisions about the state of your VM instances and the Shielded VM vTPM enables Measured Boot by performing the measurements needed to create a known good boot baseline, called the integrity policy baseline.

Application/VM-Instance uses the service account to call the service's Google API so that users aren't directly involved.
In addition to being an identity, a service account is a resource that has IAM policies attached to it. These policies determine who can use the service account.
Users with IAM roles to update the App Engine and Compute Engine instances (such as App Engine Deployer or Compute Instance Admin) can effectively run code as the service accounts used to run these instances, and indirectly gain access to all the resources for which the service accounts have access. Similarly, SSH access to a Compute Engine instance may also provide the ability to execute code as that instance/Service account.
Based on business needs, there could be multiple user-managed service accounts configured for a project. Granting the iam.serviceAccountUser or iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator roles to a user for a project gives the user access to all service accounts in the project, including service accounts that may be created in the future. This can result in elevation of privileges by using service accounts and corresponding Compute Engine instances.
In order to implement least privileges best practices, IAM users should not be assigned the Service Account User or Service Account Token Creator roles at the project level. Instead, these roles should be assigned to a user for a specific service account, giving that user access to the service account. The Service Account User allows a user to bind a service account to a long-running job service, whereas the Service Account Token Creator role allows a user to directly impersonate (or assert) the identity of a service account.","After revoking Service Account User or  Service Account Token Creator roles at the project level from all impacted user account(s), these roles should be assigned to a user(s) for specific service account(s) according to business needs.","From Google Cloud Console

Cloud Storage offers two systems for granting users permission to access your buckets and objects: Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) and Access Control Lists (ACLs). These systems act in parallel - in order for a user to access a Cloud Storage resource, only one of the systems needs to grant the user permission. Cloud IAM is used throughout Google Cloud and allows you to grant a variety of permissions at the bucket and project levels. ACLs are used only by Cloud Storage and have limited permission options, but they allow you to grant permissions on a per-object basis.
In order to support a uniform permissioning system, Cloud Storage has uniform bucket-level access. Using this feature disables ACLs for all Cloud Storage resources: access to Cloud Storage resources then is granted exclusively through Cloud IAM. Enabling uniform bucket-level access guarantees that if a Storage bucket is not publicly accessible, no object in the bucket is publicly accessible either.","If you enable uniform bucket-level access, you revoke access from users who gain their access solely through object ACLs.

Data Access audit logs record API calls that create, modify, or read user-provided data. These are disabled by default and should be enabled.
There are three kinds of Data Access audit log information:

Admin read: Records operations that read metadata or configuration information. Admin Activity audit logs record writes of metadata and configuration information that cannot be disabled.
Data read: Records operations that read user-provided data.
Data write: Records operations that write user-provided data.



It is recommended to have an effective default audit config configured in such a way that:


logtype is set to DATA_READ (to log user activity tracking) and DATA_WRITES (to log changes/tampering to user data).


audit config is enabled for all the services supported by the Data Access audit logs feature.


Logs should be captured for all users, i.e., there are no exempted users in any of the audit config sections. This will ensure overriding the audit config will not contradict the requirement.","There is no charge for Admin Activity audit logs.
Enabling the Data Access audit logs might result in your project being charged for the additional logs usage.","From Google Cloud Console

Go to Audit Logs by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/audit.
Ensure that Admin Read, Data Write, and Data Read are enabled for all Google Cloud services and that no exemptions are allowed.

From Google Cloud CLI

List the Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for the project, folder, or organization:

gcloud organizations get-iam-policy ORGANIZATION_ID
gcloud resource-manager folders get-iam-policy FOLDER_ID
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID


Policy should have a default auditConfigs section which has the logtype set to DATA_WRITES and DATA_READ for all services. Note that projects inherit settings from folders, which in turn inherit settings from the organization. When called, projects get-iam-policy, the result shows only the policies set in the project, not the policies inherited from the parent folder or organization. Nevertheless, if the parent folder has Cloud Audit Logging enabled, the project does as well.

Sample output for default audit configs may look like this:
	auditConfigs:
	- auditLogConfigs:
  	- logType: ADMIN_READ
  	- logType: DATA_WRITE
  	- logType: DATA_READ
 	 service: allServices


Any of the auditConfigs sections should not have parameter ""exemptedMembers:"" set, which will ensure that Logging is enabled for all users and no user is exempted.","From Google Cloud Console

Follow the steps at https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit/configure-data-access to enable audit logs for all Google Cloud services. Ensure that no exemptions are allowed.

From Google Cloud CLI

To read the project's IAM policy and store it in a file run a command:

gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID > /tmp/project_policy.yaml

Alternatively, the policy can be set at the organization or folder level. If setting the policy at the organization level, it is not necessary to also set it for each folder or project.
gcloud organizations get-iam-policy ORGANIZATION_ID > /tmp/org_policy.yaml
gcloud resource-manager folders get-iam-policy FOLDER_ID > /tmp/folder_policy.yaml


Edit policy in /tmp/policy.yaml, adding or changing only the audit logs configuration to:
Note: Admin Activity Logs are enabled by default, and cannot be disabled. So they are not listed in these configuration changes.

auditConfigs:
- auditLogConfigs:
  - logType: DATA_WRITE
  - logType: DATA_READ
  service: allServices

Note: exemptedMembers: is not set as audit logging should be enabled for all the users

To write new IAM policy run command:

gcloud organizations set-iam-policy ORGANIZATION_ID /tmp/org_policy.yaml
gcloud resource-manager folders set-iam-policy FOLDER_ID /tmp/folder_policy.yaml
gcloud projects set-iam-policy PROJECT_ID /tmp/project_policy.yaml

If the preceding command reports a conflict with another change, then repeat these steps, starting with the first step.","Admin Activity logs are always enabled. They cannot be disabled.

Admin Activity logs contain log entries for API calls or other administrative actions that modify the configuration or metadata of resources. Admin Activity audit logs are enabled for all services and cannot be configured.


Data Access audit logs record API calls that create, modify, or read user-provided data. These are disabled by default and should be enabled.
There are three kinds of Data Access audit log information:

Admin read: Records operations that read metadata or configuration information. Admin Activity audit logs record writes of metadata and configuration information that cannot be disabled.
Data read: Records operations that read user-provided data.
Data write: Records operations that write user-provided data.



It is recommended to have an effective default audit config configured in such a way that:


logtype is set to DATA_READ (to log user activity tracking) and DATA_WRITES (to log changes/tampering to user data).


audit config is enabled for all the services supported by the Data Access audit logs feature.


Logs should be captured for all users, i.e., there are no exempted users in any of the audit config sections. This will ensure overriding the audit config will not contradict the requirement.","There is no charge for Admin Activity audit logs.
