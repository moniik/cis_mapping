Apple collects information here, such as the games users play and when they play them, all scores and achievements, and the challenges users send and receive. This information is used to track users' high scores, achievements, and challenges and to improve Game Center.

This is more of a best practice than a security measure. If the host name and the computer name are the same, computer support may be able to track problems down more easily.
For organizations or for users that self-administer their own computers, it is important to not use sensitive or personal information in computer names. The name of a computer that uses untrusted networks will be exposed at a minimum to the responsible network team of that network. For instance, having your name as your hostname can provide useful knowledge to an attacker monitoring the network you may be connected to.
Examples of possibly inappropriate content in computer names include:

User directory account names
Computer directory account names where machine accounts exist
Contact phone numbers
Physical locations of offices or residences
Personal information that can be augmented with Facebook data to assist social engineering attacks

Standard naming patterns avoid collisions and mitigate risk for computer users.
With mobile devices, using DHCP IP tracking has serious drawbacks. Hostname or computer name tracking makes much more sense for those organizations that can implement it. If the computer is using different names for the ""Computer Name"" DNS and Directory environments, it can be difficult to manage Macs in an Enterprise asset inventory.","Part of IT security is having visibility into all of the devices for which an organization is responsible. Without a complete inventory, it is impossible to ensure all security controls are met on all organizational devices.
Default macOS naming deconfliction controls can create issues for appropriate management and tracking as well as privacy exposure. By default, the name of a macOS computer is derived from the first user created. If the user has multiple computers or an image is used without an appropriate name change, there will be multiple computers with names derived from the same user for discovery deconfliction. How many ""Ron Colvin's MacBook Pro"" should there be, and are any missing?
Local network auto renaming to avoid collisions also allows for the enumeration of local computer names. Computers should not be named after their users, especially on untrusted networks. For social engineering purposes, the computer name should not provide a full name of the user or an identifiable name that might be used to assist in targeted user attacks.
A documented plan to better enable a complete device inventory without exposing user or organizational information is part of mature security.","","Graphical Method:

This application allows a user with admin privileges and an Apple Account to browse Apple's online App Store, purchase (including no-cost purchases), and install new applications, bypassing Enterprise software inventory controls. Any admin user can install software in the /Applications directory whether from internet downloads, thumb drives, optical media, cloud storage, or even binaries through email. Even standard users can run executables downloaded to their home folder by default. The source of the software is not nearly as important as a consistent audit of all installed software for patch compliance and appropriateness.
A single user desktop where the user, administrator, and the person approving software are all the same person probably does not need to audit software inventory to this extent. It is helpful in the case of stability problems or malware, however.
Scan systems on a monthly basis and determine the number of unauthorized pieces of software that are installed. Verify that if an unauthorized piece of software is found one month, it is removed from the system the next.
Export System Information through the built-in System Information Application or other third-party tools on an organizationally defined timetable.","Part of comprehensive IT security involves device management and ensuring that all software is authorized and patched. Checking for macOS updates and app updates are relatively simple for the end user, and can even be updated with minimal privileges from trusted sources, if enabled. Remote monitoring of the patch status for software maintained through Apple is very well supported by management applications.

The best parallel for Enterprise environments is that everyone who has a Dropbox account can see everything that is at the top level but can't see your pictures. Similarly with macOS, users can see into every new Directory that is created because of the default permissions.
Home folders should be restricted to access only by the user. Sharing should be used on dedicated servers or cloud instances that are managing access controls. Some environments may encounter problems if execute rights are removed as well as read and write. Either no access or execute only for group or others is acceptable.","Allowing all users to view the top level of all networked users' home folder may not be desirable since it may lead to the revelation of sensitive information.","If implemented, users will not be able to use the ""Public"" folders in other users' home folders.

The output will show what user folders are not secure.

% /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod -R og-rw /Users/<username>

A password hint is required, but it is recommended that you do not use any identifying information for the password

Note: In macOS 12.0 Monterey and previous, the existing Time Machine drive could have encryption added without formatting it. This is no longer possible in macOS 13.0 Ventura.

It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting, it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are near each other.
In many ways, this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you.
While there are positives to AirDrop, there are privacy concerns that could expose personal information. For that reason, AirDrop should be disabled, and should only be enabled when needed and disabled afterwards. The recommendation against enabling the sharing is not based on any known lack of security in the protocol, but for specific user operational concerns.

If AirDrop is enabled, the Mac is advertising that a Mac is addressable on the local network and open to either unwanted AirDrop upload requests or for a negotiation on whether the remote user is in the user's contacts list. Neither process is desirable.
In most known use cases, AirDrop use qualifies as ad hoc networking when it involves Apple device users deciding to exchange a file using the service. AirDrop can thus be enabled on the fly for that exchange.

While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers.
macOS does have an IP-based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in the Network sub-section. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Since most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP-based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server.","The SSH server built into macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications, including email, web browser, and productivity tools, should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management toolsets that do utilize SSH. If they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known, trusted IP addresses and appropriate administrator service accounts.
For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions, there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access, including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered:

Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks. This is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system, but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account, they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication, directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out.
Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key, they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server.
Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks, but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark.","Graphical Method:

While it is possible that Siri will be used for local actions rather than Internet searches, Siri could, in theory, tell Apple about confidential Programs and Projects that should not be revealed. This appears to be a usage edge case.
In cases where sensitive or protected data is processed and Siri could expose that information through assisting a user in navigating their machine, it should be disabled. Siri does need to phone home to Apple, so it should not be available from air-gapped networks as part of its requirements.
Most of the use case data published has shown that Siri is a tremendous time saver on iOS where multiple screens and menus need to be navigated through. Information like sports scores, weather, movie times, and simple to-do items on existing calendars can be easily found with Siri.

When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume, the encryption keys remain in memory.

Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for ""standbydelay"" is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data, this value might be adjusted. The desktop would have to retain power, however, so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked.
MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium, or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night, the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into the system when it resumes.
MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system.

It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting, it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are near each other.
In many ways, this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you.
While there are positives to AirDrop, there are privacy concerns that could expose personal information. For that reason, AirDrop should be disabled, and should only be enabled when needed and disabled afterwards. The recommendation against enabling the sharing is not based on any known lack of security in the protocol, but for specific user operational concerns.

If AirDrop is enabled, the Mac is advertising that a Mac is addressable on the local network and open to either unwanted AirDrop upload requests or for a negotiation on whether the remote user is in the user's contacts list. Neither process is desirable.
In most known use cases, AirDrop use qualifies as ad hoc networking when it involves Apple device users deciding to exchange a file using the service. AirDrop can thus be enabled on the fly for that exchange.

For organizations concerned about any use of AirDrop because of Digital Loss Prevention (DLP) monitoring on other protocols, JAMF has an article on reviewing AirDrop logs.

While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers.
macOS does have an IP-based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in the Network sub-section. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Since most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP-based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server.","The SSH server built into macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications, including email, web browser, and productivity tools, should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management toolsets that do utilize SSH. If they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known, trusted IP addresses and appropriate administrator service accounts.
For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions, there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access, including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered:

Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks. This is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system, but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account, they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication, directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out.
Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key, they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server.
Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks, but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark.","Graphical Method:

All use of Touch ID requires the presence of a password and the use of that password after every reboot, or when more than 48 hours has elapsed since the device was last unlocked.

Normal day-to-day work operations can eliminate the use of console password entry unless a reboot is required other than on Monday morning. The infrequency of password screen unlock can enable a more complicated pass phrase that is seldom used.

It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting, it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are near each other.
In many ways, this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you.
While there are positives to AirDrop, there are privacy concerns that could expose personal information. For that reason, AirDrop should be disabled, and should only be enabled when needed and disabled afterwards. The recommendation against enabling the sharing is not based on any known lack of security in the protocol, but for specific user operational concerns.

If AirDrop is enabled, the Mac is advertising that a Mac is addressable on the local network and open to either unwanted AirDrop upload requests or for a negotiation on whether the remote user is in the user's contacts list. Neither process is desirable.
In most known use cases, AirDrop use qualifies as ad hoc networking when it involves Apple device users deciding to exchange a file using the service. AirDrop can thus be enabled on the fly for that exchange.

With encryption in place, it makes it difficult for an outside party to access your data if they get physical possession of the computer. One very large weakness in data protection with FileVault is the level of protection on backup volumes. If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not, it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting up a Time Machine backup. Using this option does require some password management, particularly if a large drive is used with multiple computers. A unique, complex password to unlock the drive can be stored in keychains on multiple systems for ease of use.

This capability mirrors what Microsoft is doing with the use of OneDrive and Office 365. There are concerns with using this capability.
The storage space that Apple provides for free is used by users with iCloud mail, all of a user's Photo Library created with the ever larger Multi-Pixel iPhone cameras, and all iOS Backups. Adding a synchronization capability for users who have files going back a decade or more, storage may be tight using the free 5GB provided without purchasing much larger storage capacity from Apple. Users with multiple computers running 10.12 and above with unique content on each will have issues as well.
Enterprise users may not be allowed to store Enterprise information in a third-party public cloud. In previous implementations, such as iCloud Drive or DropBox, the user selected what files were synchronized even if there were no other controls. The new feature synchronizes all files in a folder widely used to put working files.
