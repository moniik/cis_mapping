## Overview

All CIS Benchmarks focus on technical configuration settings used to maintain and/or
increase the security of the addressed technology, and they should be used in
**conjunction with other essential cyber hygiene tasks like:**

  - Monitoring the base operating system for vulnerabilities and quickly updating with

the latest security patches

  - Monitoring applications and libraries for vulnerabilities and quickly updating with

the latest security patches

In the end, the CIS Benchmarks are designed as a key component of a comprehensive
cybersecurity program.

This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration
posture for Microsoft Windows.

This secure configuration guide is based on Windows 11 and is intended for all
versions of the Windows 11 operating system, including older versions. This secure
configuration guide was tested against Microsoft Windows 11 Release 23H2
**Enterprise.**

To ensure all new and updated group policy objects (GPOs) are installed on the system,
please download the latest version of the ADMX/ADML templates for Windows 11.
[Templates can be downloaded from Microsoft at: Download ADMX Templates for](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=105667)
[Windows 11 2022 Update [22H2] from Official Microsoft Download Center.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=105667)
To obtain the latest version of this secure configuration guide, please visit
[https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/. If you have questions, comments, or have](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/)
[identified ways to improve this guide, please write us at feedback@cisecurity.org.](mailto:feedback@cisecurity.org)

### Intended Audience

The Windows CIS Microsoft Windows Benchmarks are written for Active Directory
**domain-joined systems using Group Policy, not standalone/workgroup systems.**
Adjustments/tailoring to some recommendations will be needed to maintain functionality
if attempting to implement CIS hardening on standalone systems or a system running in
the cloud.

### Consensus Guidance

This CIS Benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of a
global community of subject matter experts. The process combines real world
experience with data-based information to create technology specific guidance to assist
users to secure their environments. Consensus participants provide perspective from a
diverse set of backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and
compliance, security research, operations, government, and legal.

Each CIS Benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase
occurs during initial Benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts
convene to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the Benchmark. This discussion
occurs until consensus has been reached on Benchmark recommendations. The
second phase begins after the Benchmark has been published. During this phase, all
feedback provided by the Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for
incorporation in the Benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus
[process, please visit https://workbench.cisecurity.org/.](https://workbench.cisecurity.org/)

## Recommendation Definitions

The following defines the various components included in a CIS recommendation as
applicable. If any of the components are not applicable it will be noted or the
component will not be included in the recommendation.

### Title

Concise description for the recommendation's intended configuration.

### Assessment Status

An assessment status is included for every recommendation. The assessment status
indicates whether the given recommendation can be automated or requires manual
steps to implement. Both statuses are equally important and are determined and
supported as defined below:

#### Automated

Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control can be fully
automated and validated to a pass/fail state. Recommendations will include the
necessary information to implement automation.

#### Manual

Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control cannot be
fully automated and requires all or some manual steps to validate that the configured
state is set as expected. The expected state can vary depending on the environment.

### Profile

A collection of recommendations for securing a technology or a supporting platform.
Most benchmarks include at least a Level 1 and Level 2 Profile. Level 2 extends Level 1
recommendations and is not a standalone profile. The Profile Definitions section in the
benchmark provides the definitions as they pertain to the recommendations included for
the technology.

### Description

Detailed information pertaining to the setting with which the recommendation is
concerned. In some cases, the description will include the recommended value.

### Rationale Statement

Detailed reasoning for the recommendation to provide the user a clear and concise
understanding on the importance of the recommendation.

Page 31


-----

### Impact Statement 

Any security, functionality, or operational consequences that can result from following
the recommendation.

### Audit Procedure 

Systematic instructions for determining if the target system complies with the
recommendation.

### Remediation Procedure

Systematic instructions for applying recommendations to the target system to bring it
into compliance according to the recommendation.

### Default Value

Default value for the given setting in this recommendation, if known. If not known, either
not configured or not defined will be applied.

### References

Additional documentation relative to the recommendation.

### CIS Critical Security Controls[®] (CIS Controls[®])

The mapping between a recommendation and the CIS Controls is organized by CIS
Controls version, Safeguard, and Implementation Group (IG). The Benchmark in its
entirety addresses the CIS Controls safeguards of (v7) “5.1 - Establish Secure
Configurations” and (v8) '4.1 - Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process”
so individual recommendations will not be mapped to these safeguards.

### Additional Information 

Supplementary information that does not correspond to any other field but may be
useful to the user.

Page 32


-----

### Profile Definitions 

The following configuration profiles are defined by this Benchmark:

  - **Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)**

Items in this profile intend to:

`o` be the starting baseline for most organizations;

`o` be practical and prudent;

`o` provide a clear security benefit; and

`o` not inhibit the utility of the technology beyond acceptable means.

  - **Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)**

This profile extends the "Level 1 (L1)" profile and includes BitLocker-related
recommendations.

  - **Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited**
**functionality)**

This profile extends the "Level 1 (L1)" profile. Items in this profile exhibit one or
more of the following characteristics:

`o` are intended for environments or use cases where security is more critical

than manageability and usability;

`o` may negatively inhibit the utility or performance of the technology; and

`o` limit the ability of remote management/access.

**Note: Implementation of Level 2 requires that both Level 1 and Level 2 settings**
are applied.

  - **Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)**

This profile extends the "Level 2 (L2)" profile and includes BitLocker-related
recommendations.

  - **BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed**

This profile contains BitLocker-related recommendations, if your organization
chooses to use it. It is intended be an optional "add-on" to the Level 1 (L1) or
Level 2 (L2) profiles.

### 1.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more password(s)' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to
be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for
this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for standalone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24
passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum
password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password.

The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s).

**Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings**
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be
globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings
are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password
policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be
defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from
Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

**Note #2: As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum**
[limit of 24 saved passwords. For more information, please visit Enforce password](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/enforce-password-history)
[history (Windows 10) - Windows security | Microsoft Docs.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/enforce-password-history)

**Rationale:**

The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can
determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have
been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left
unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if
users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good
password policy is greatly reduced.

If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same
small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum
password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can
reuse their original password.

Page 36


-----

**Impact:**

The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every
time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their
passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their
passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may
create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02,
and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an
excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase
administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help
desk to reset them frequently.

### 1.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '365 or fewer days, but not 0' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires.

Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the
password will never expire.

Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password
the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this
value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to
users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.

The recommended state for this setting is 365 or fewer days, but not 0.

**Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings**
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be
globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings
are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password
policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be
defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from
Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

**Rationale:**

The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a
brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the
user sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that
users are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because
that allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the
valid user has authorized access.

**Impact:**

If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their
passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization,
because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them. If the
value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is
reduced because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user
passwords or to use compromised accounts.

### 1.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password age' is set to '1 or more day(s)' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before
you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999
days. (You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The
default value for this setting is 0 days.

The recommended state for this setting is: 1 or more day(s)).

**Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings**
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be
globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings
are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password
policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be
defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from
Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

**Rationale:**

Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to
remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise.
Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific
individual's user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old
passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of
security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history
setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the
Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12
passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the
password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age
setting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a
number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective.

**Impact:**

If an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the
password when the user first logs on, the administrator must select the User must
change password at next logon check box, or the user will not be able to change the
password until the next day.

### 1.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more character(s)' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password
for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best
password length for an organization, but perhaps "passphrase" is a better term than
"password." In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and
can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as "I want to drink a $5 milkshake" is a
valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string
of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated
about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password
length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length
setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your
organization's business requirements.

The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s).

**Note: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the**
Local Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy
Management Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters.
However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to
a 20 character minimum password length.

**Note #2: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings**
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be
globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings
are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password
policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be
defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from
Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

**Rationale:**

Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common
words and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of
characters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can
use tools to discover the accounts and passwords.

Page 42


-----

**Impact:**

Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an
organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose
it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account
lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with
forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your
users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger
number of character combinations, much harder to discover.

**Note: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not**
support passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older
operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use
accounts that require long passwords.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 14 or
```
more character(s):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Password Policy\Minimum password length

```
**Default Value:**

7 characters on domain members. 0 characters on stand-alone servers.

### 1.1.5 (L1) Ensure 'Password must meet complexity requirements' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic
requirements for strong passwords.

When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements:

  - Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed
two consecutive characters

  - Be at least six characters in length

  - Contain characters from three of the following categories:

  - English uppercase characters (A through Z)

  - English lowercase characters (a through z)

  - Base 10 digits (0 through 9)

  - Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %)

  - A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the
previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific.

Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For
instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 26 to the
power of 7 (approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion) possible combinations.
At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it
would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case
sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive
alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character
password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations.
Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it
would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will
significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard
characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it
difficult to mount a brute force attack.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Page 45


-----

**Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings**
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be
globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings
are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password
policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be
defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from
Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

**Rationale:**

Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover
with several publicly available tools.

**Impact:**

If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls
for locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to
passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to
comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty.

If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom
version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength
rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row
characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT
key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also
perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain
common dictionary words or fragments.

Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of
a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy
users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider
a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128 - 0159
range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric
characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

### 1.1.6 (L1) Ensure 'Relax minimum password length limits' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

This policy setting determines whether the minimum password length setting can be
increased beyond the legacy limit of 14 characters. For more information, please see
[the following Microsoft Security Blog.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/security-baseline-draft-windows-10-and-windows-server-version/ba-p/1419213)

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This setting only affects local accounts on the computer. Domain accounts are**
only affected by settings on the Domain Controllers, because that is where domain
accounts are stored.

**Rationale:**

This setting will enable the enforcement of longer and generally stronger passwords or
passphrases where MFA is not in use.

**Impact:**

### 1.1.7 (L1) Ensure 'Store passwords using reversible encryption' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether the operating system stores passwords in a way
that uses reversible encryption, which provides support for application protocols that
require knowledge of the user's password for authentication purposes. Passwords that
are stored with reversible encryption are essentially the same as plaintext versions of
the passwords.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings**
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be
globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings
are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password
policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be
defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from
Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

**Rationale:**

Enabling this policy setting allows the operating system to store passwords in a weaker
format that is much more susceptible to compromise and weakens your system
security.

**Impact:**

If your organization uses either the CHAP authentication protocol through remote
access or IAS services or Digest Authentication in IIS, you must configure this policy
setting to Enabled. This setting is extremely dangerous to apply through Group Policy
on a user-by-user basis, because it requires the appropriate user account object to be
opened in Active Directory Users and Computers.

**Description:**

This policy setting determines the length of time that must pass before a locked account
is unlocked and a user can try to log on again. The setting does this by specifying the
number of minutes a locked out account will remain unavailable. If the value for this
policy setting is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an
administrator manually unlocks them.

Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a
high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help
desk receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the
length of time a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help
desk if they have an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).

**Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings**
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be
globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings
are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password
policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be
defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from
Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

**Rationale:**

A denial of service (DoS) condition can be created if an attacker abuses the Account
lockout threshold and repeatedly attempts to log on with a specific account. Once you
configure the Account lockout threshold setting, the account will be locked out after the
specified number of failed attempts. If you configure the Account lockout duration
setting to 0, then the account will remain locked out until an administrator unlocks it
manually.

**Impact:**

Although it may seem like a good idea to configure this policy setting to never
automatically unlock an account, such a configuration can increase the number of
requests that your organization's help desk receives to unlock accounts that were
locked by mistake.

### 1.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Account lockout threshold' is set to '5 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but not 0' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before the account is
locked. Setting this policy to 0 does not conform to the benchmark as doing so disables
the account lockout threshold.

The recommended state for this setting is: 5 or fewer invalid logon attempt(s), but
```
not 0.

```
**Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings**
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be
globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings
are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password
policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be
defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from
Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

**Rationale:**

Setting an account lockout threshold reduces the likelihood that an online password
brute force attack will be successful. Setting the account lockout threshold too low
introduces risk of increased accidental lockouts and/or a malicious actor intentionally
locking out accounts.

**Impact:**

If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable until it is reset by
an administrator or until the account lockout duration expires. This setting may generate
additional help desk calls.

If you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by
deliberately generating failed logons for multiple user, therefore you should also
configure the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value.

If you configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an
attacker's attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack might go
undetected if a robust audit mechanism is not in place.

### 1.2.3 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Administrator account lockout' is set to 'Enabled' (Manual)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether the built-in Administrator account is subject to
the following Account Lockout Policy settings: Account lockout duration, Account
_lockout threshold, and Reset account lockout counter. By default, this account is_
excluded from the account lockout controls and will never be locked out with repeated
bad password attempts.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This setting applies only to OSes patched as of October 11, 2022 (see MS**
[KB5020282).](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5020282-account-lockout-available-for-built-in-local-administrators-bce45c4d-f28d-43ad-b6fe-70156cb2dc00)

**Rationale:**

Enabling account lockout policies for the built-in Administrator account will reduce the
likelihood of a successful brute force attack.

### 1.2.4 (L1) Ensure 'Reset account lockout counter after' is set to '15 or more minute(s)' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines the length of time before the Account lockout threshold
resets to zero. The default value for this policy setting is Not Defined. If the Account
lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for
the Account lockout duration setting.

If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval
that is too long, your environment could be vulnerable to a DoS attack. An attacker
could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the
organization, which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the
account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a
reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for
a set period until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.

The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or more minute(s).

**Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings**
(section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be
globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings
are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the
computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password
policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be
defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from
Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center.

**Rationale:**

Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their
password multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset
account lockout counter after setting determines the number of minutes that must
elapse before the counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset
to 0.

Page 59


-----

**Impact:**

If you do not configure this policy setting or if the value is configured to an interval that is
too long, a DoS attack could occur. An attacker could maliciously attempt to log on to
each user's account numerous times and lock out their accounts as described in the
preceding paragraphs. If you do not configure the Reset account lockout counter after
setting, administrators would have to manually unlock all accounts. If you configure this
policy setting to a reasonable value the users would be locked out for some period, after
which their accounts would unlock automatically. Be sure that you notify users of the
values used for this policy setting so that they will wait for the lockout timer to expire
before they call the help desk about their inability to log on.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 15 or
```
more minute(s):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account
Policies\Account Lockout Policy\Reset account lockout counter after

```
**Default Value:**

None, because this policy setting only has meaning when an Account lockout threshold
is specified. When an Account lockout threshold is configured, Windows automatically
suggests a value of 30 minutes.

### 2.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Access this computer from the network' is set to 'Administrators, Remote Desktop Users' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows other users on the network to connect to the computer and is
required by various network protocols that include Server Message Block (SMB)-based
protocols, NetBIOS, Common Internet File System (CIFS), and Component Object
Model Plus (COM+).

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Remote Desktop Users.

**Note: If your organization is using Microsoft Defender for Identity (formerly Azure**
Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP)), the (organization-named) Defender for
Identity Directory Service Account (DSA), will also need to be granted the same Access
```
this computer from the network User Right Assignment. For more information on

```
[adding the service account please see Make sure the DSA is allowed to access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-for-identity/deploy/remote-calls-sam#make-sure-the-dsa-is-allowed-to-access-computers-from-the-network-optional)

**Rationale:**

Users who can connect from their computer to the network can access resources on
target computers for which they have permission. For example, the Access this
**computer from the network user right is required for users to connect to shared**
printers and folders. If this user right is assigned to the Everyone group, then anyone will
be able to read the files in those shared folders. However, this situation is unlikely for
new installations of Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1), because the
default share and NTFS permissions in Windows Server 2003 do not include the
```
Everyone group. This vulnerability may have a higher level of risk for computers that you

```
upgrade from Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, because the default permissions for
these operating systems are not as restrictive as the default permissions in Windows
Server 2003.

Page 65


-----

**Impact:**

If you remove the Access this computer from the network user right on Domain
Controllers for all users, no one will be able to log on to the domain or use network
resources. If you remove this user right on Member Servers, users will not be able to
connect to those servers through the network. Successful negotiation of IPsec
connections requires that the initiating machine has this right, therefore if using IPsec, it
is recommended that it be assigned to the Authenticated Users group. If you have
installed optional components such as ASP.NET or Internet Information Services (IIS),
you may need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those
components. It is important to verify that authorized users are assigned this user right
for the computers they need to access the network.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 2.2.3 (L1) Ensure 'Act as part of the operating system' is set to 'No One' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

**Description:**

This policy setting allows a process to assume the identity of any user and thus gain
access to the resources that the user is authorized to access.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One.

**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

The Act as part of the operating system user right is extremely powerful. Anyone with
this user right can take complete control of the computer and erase evidence of their
activities.

**Impact:**

There should be little or no impact because the Act as part of the operating system
user right is rarely needed by any accounts other than the Local System account, which
implicitly has this right.

### 2.2.4 (L1) Ensure 'Adjust memory quotas for a process' is set to 'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows a user to adjust the maximum amount of memory that is
available to a process. The ability to adjust memory quotas is useful for system tuning,
but it can be abused. In the wrong hands, it could be used to launch a denial of service
(DoS) attack.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK
```
SERVICE.

```
**Rationale:**

A user with the Adjust memory quotas for a process user right can reduce the
amount of memory that is available to any process, which could cause business-critical
network applications to become slow or to fail. In the wrong hands, this privilege could
be used to start a denial of service (DoS) attack.

**Impact:**

Organizations that have not restricted users to roles with limited privileges will find it
difficult to impose this countermeasure. Also, if you have installed optional components
such as ASP.NET or IIS, you may need to assign the Adjust memory quotas for a
**process user right to additional accounts that are required by those components.**
Otherwise, this countermeasure should have no impact on most computers. If this user
right is necessary for a user account, it can be assigned to a local computer account
instead of a domain account.

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

### 2.2.5 (L1) Ensure 'Allow log on locally' is set to 'Administrators, Users' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which users can interactively log on to computers in your
environment. Logons that are initiated by pressing the CTRL+ALT+DEL key sequence
on the client computer keyboard require this user right. Users who attempt to log on
through Terminal Services / Remote Desktop Services or IIS also require this user right.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Users.

**Note: The Guest account is also assigned this user right by default. Although this**
account is disabled by default, it's recommended that you configure this setting through
Group Policy. However, this user right should generally be restricted to the
```
Administrators and Users groups. Assign this user right to the Backup Operators group

```
if your organization requires that they have this capability.

**Rationale:**

Any account with the Allow log on locally user right can log on at the console of the
computer. If you do not restrict this user right to legitimate users who need to be able to
log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users could download and run
malicious software to elevate their privileges.

**Impact:**

If you remove these default groups, you could limit the abilities of users who are
assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment. You should confirm that
delegated activities will not be adversely affected by any changes that you make to the
**Allow log on locally user right.**

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

### 2.2.6 (L1) Ensure 'Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services' is set to 'Administrators, Remote Desktop Users' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which users or groups have the right to log on as a
Remote Desktop Services client. If your organization uses Remote Assistance as part of
its help desk strategy, create a group and assign it this user right through Group Policy.
If the help desk in your organization does not use Remote Assistance, assign this user
right only to the Administrators group or use the Restricted Groups feature to ensure
that no user accounts are part of the Remote Desktop Users group.

Restrict this user right to the Administrators group, and possibly the Remote Desktop
```
Users group, to prevent unwanted users from gaining access to computers on your

```
network by means of the Remote Assistance feature.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Remote Desktop Users.

**Note: The above list is to be treated as a whitelist, which implies that the above**
principals need not be present for assessment of this recommendation to pass.

**Note #2: In all versions of Windows prior to Windows 7, Remote Desktop Services**
was known as Terminal Services, so you should substitute the older term if comparing
against an older OS.

**Rationale:**

Any account with the Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services user right can
log on to the remote console of the computer. If you do not restrict this user right to
legitimate users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users
could download and run malicious software to elevate their privileges.

**Impact:**

Removal of the Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services user right from other
groups or membership changes in these default groups could limit the abilities of users
who perform specific administrative roles in your environment. You should confirm that
delegated activities will not be adversely affected.

**Audit:**

### 2.2.7 (L1) Ensure 'Back up files and directories' is set to 'Administrators' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows users to circumvent file and directory permissions to back up
the system. This user right is enabled only when an application (such as NTBACKUP)
attempts to access a file or directory through the NTFS file system backup application
programming interface (API). Otherwise, the assigned file and directory permissions
apply.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

Users who are able to back up data from a computer could take the backup media to a
non-domain computer on which they have administrative privileges and restore the
data. They could take ownership of the files and view any unencrypted data that is
contained within the backup set.

**Impact:**

Changes in the membership of the groups that have the Back up files and directories
user right could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative
roles in your environment. You should confirm that authorized backup administrators
are still able to perform backup operations.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```

### 2.2.8 (L1) Ensure 'Change the system time' is set to 'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on
the internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this
user right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is
changed, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events
occurred.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE.

**Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain**
Controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication
protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain
authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will
occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not
synchronized with the Domain Controllers.

Page 78


-----

**Rationale:**

Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For
example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on
files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that
belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log
on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol
requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an
administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may
cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.

The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member
Servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically
synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways:

  - All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain
Controller as their inbound time partner.

  - All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller
(PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner.

  - All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the
selection of their inbound time partner.

  - The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for
the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer
to synchronize with a reliable external time server.

This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the
system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize
with a time server that is not accurate.

**Impact:**

There should be no impact, because time synchronization for most organizations should
be fully automated for all computers that belong to the domain. Computers that do not
belong to the domain should be configured to synchronize with an external source.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

### 2.2.9 (L1) Ensure 'Change the time zone' is set to 'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, Users' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting determines which users can change the time zone of the computer. This
ability holds no great danger for the computer and may be useful for mobile workers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, Users.

**Rationale:**

Changing the time zone represents little vulnerability because the system time is not
affected. This setting merely enables users to display their preferred time zone while
being synchronized with Domain Controllers in different time zones.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Description:**

This policy setting allows users to change the size of the pagefile. By making the
pagefile extremely large or extremely small, an attacker could easily affect the
performance of a compromised computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

**Rationale:**

Users who can change the page file size could make it extremely small or move the file
to a highly fragmented storage volume, which could cause reduced computer
performance.

### 2.2.11 (L1) Ensure 'Create a token object' is set to 'No One' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows a process to create an access token, which may provide
elevated rights to access sensitive data.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One.

**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

A user account that is given this user right has complete control over the system and
can lead to the system being compromised. It is highly recommended that you do not
assign any user accounts this right.

The operating system examines a user's access token to determine the level of the
user's privileges. Access tokens are built when users log on to the local computer or
connect to a remote computer over a network. When you revoke a privilege, the change
is immediately recorded, but the change is not reflected in the user's access token until
the next time the user logs on or connects. Users with the ability to create or modify
tokens can change the level of access for any currently logged on account. They could
escalate their own privileges or create a DoS condition.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 2.2.12 (L1) Ensure 'Create global objects' is set to 'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether users can create global objects that are available
to all sessions. Users can still create objects that are specific to their own session if they
do not have this user right.

Users who can create global objects could affect processes that run under other users'
sessions. This capability could lead to a variety of problems, such as application failure
or data corruption.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK
```
SERVICE, SERVICE.

```
**Rationale:**

Users who can create global objects could affect Windows services and processes that
run under other user or system accounts. This capability could lead to a variety of
problems, such as application failure, data corruption and elevation of privilege.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Description:**

This user right is useful to kernel-mode components that extend the object namespace.
However, components that run in kernel mode have this user right inherently. Therefore,
it is typically not necessary to specifically assign this user right.

### 2.2.14 (L1) Configure 'Create symbolic links' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which users can create symbolic links. In Windows Vista,
existing NTFS file system objects, such as files and folders, can be accessed by
referring to a new kind of file system object called a symbolic link. A symbolic link is a
pointer (much like a shortcut or .lnk file) to another file system object, which can be a
file, folder, shortcut or another symbolic link. The difference between a shortcut and a
symbolic link is that a shortcut only works from within the Windows shell. To other
programs and applications, shortcuts are just another file, whereas with symbolic links,
the concept of a shortcut is implemented as a feature of the NTFS file system.

Symbolic links can potentially expose security vulnerabilities in applications that are not
designed to use them. For this reason, the privilege for creating symbolic links should
only be assigned to trusted users. By default, only Administrators can create symbolic
links.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators and (when the Hyper-V
feature is installed) NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines.

**Rationale:**

Users who have the Create symbolic links user right could inadvertently or maliciously
expose your system to symbolic link attacks. Symbolic link attacks can be used to
change the permissions on a file, to corrupt data, to destroy data, or as a Denial of
Service attack.

**Impact:**

In most cases there will be no impact because this is the default configuration.
However, on Windows Workstations with the Hyper-V feature installed, this user right
should also be granted to the special group NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines otherwise you will not be able to create new virtual machines.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

### 2.2.15 (L1) Ensure 'Debug programs' is set to 'Administrators' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which user accounts will have the right to attach a
debugger to any process or to the kernel, which provides complete access to sensitive
and critical operating system components. Developers who are debugging their own
applications do not need to be assigned this user right; however, developers who are
debugging new system components will need it.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

The Debug programs user right can be exploited to capture sensitive computer
information from system memory, or to access and modify kernel or application
structures. Some attack tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and
other private security information, or to insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug
**programs user right is assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk**
from this vulnerability.

**Impact:**

If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. However, typical
circumstances rarely require this capability on production computers. If a problem arises
that requires an application to be debugged on a production server, you can move the
server to a different OU temporarily and assign the Debug programs user right to a
separate Group Policy for that OU.

The service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs
user right; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail.

Tools that are used to manage processes will be unable to affect processes that are not
owned by the person who runs the tools. For example, the Windows Server 2003
Resource Kit tool Kill.exe requires this user right for administrators to terminate

### 2.2.16 (L1) Ensure 'Deny access to this computer from the network' to include 'Guests, Local account' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting prohibits users from connecting to a computer from across the
network, which would allow users to access and potentially modify data remotely. In
high security environments, there should be no need for remote users to access data on
a computer. Instead, file sharing should be accomplished through the use of network
servers. This user right supersedes the Access this computer from the network user
right if an account is subject to both policies.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests, Local account.

**Caution: Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) workstation as described above**
may result in an inability to remotely administer the workstation.

**Note: The security identifier Local account is not available in Windows 7 and Windows**
[8.0 unless MSKB 2871997 has been installed.](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2871997)

**Rationale:**

Users who can log on to the computer over the network can enumerate lists of account
names, group names, and shared resources. Users with permission to access shared
folders and files can connect over the network and possibly view or modify data.

**Impact:**

If you configure the Deny access to this computer from the network user right for
other groups, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific
administrative roles in your environment. You should verify that delegated tasks will not
be negatively affected.

### 2.2.17 (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on as a batch job' to include 'Guests' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which accounts will not be able to log on to the computer
as a batch job. A batch job is not a batch (.bat) file, but rather a batch-queue facility.
Accounts that use the Task Scheduler to schedule jobs need this user right.

This user right supersedes the Log on as a batch job user right, which could be used
to allow accounts to schedule jobs that consume excessive system resources. Such an
occurrence could cause a DoS condition. Failure to assign this user right to the
recommended accounts can be a security risk.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests.

**Rationale:**

Accounts that have the Log on as a batch job user right could be used to schedule
jobs that could consume excessive computer resources and cause a DoS condition.

**Impact:**

If you assign the Deny log on as a batch job user right to other accounts, you could
deny users who are assigned to specific administrative roles the ability to perform their
required job activities. You should confirm that delegated tasks will not be affected
adversely.

For example, if you assign this user right to the IWAM_(ComputerName) account, the
MSM Management Point will fail. On a newly installed computer that runs Windows
Server 2003 this account does not belong to the Guests group, but on a computer that
was upgraded from Windows 2000 this account is a member of the Guests group.
Therefore, it is important that you understand which accounts belong to any groups that
you assign the Deny log on as a batch job user right.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

### 2.2.18 (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on as a service' to include 'Guests' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This security setting determines which service accounts are prevented from registering
a process as a service. This user right supersedes the Log on as a service user right if
an account is subject to both policies.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests.

**Note: This security setting does not apply to the System, Local Service, or Network**
```
Service accounts.

```
**Rationale:**

Accounts that can log on as a service could be used to configure and start new
unauthorized services, such as a keylogger or other malicious software. The benefit of
the specified countermeasure is somewhat reduced by the fact that only users with
administrative privileges can install and configure services, and an attacker who has
already attained that level of access could configure the service to run with the System
account.

**Impact:**

If you assign the Deny log on as a service user right to specific accounts, services
may not be able to start and a DoS condition could result.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

### 2.2.19 (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on locally' to include 'Guests' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This security setting determines which users are prevented from logging on at the
computer. This policy setting supersedes the Allow log on locally policy setting if an
account is subject to both policies.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests.

**Important: If you apply this security policy to the Everyone group, no one will be able to**
log on locally.

**Rationale:**

Any account with the ability to log on locally could be used to log on at the console of
the computer. If this user right is not restricted to legitimate users who need to log on to
the console of the computer, unauthorized users might download and run malicious
software that elevates their privileges.

**Impact:**

If you assign the Deny log on locally user right to additional accounts, you could limit
the abilities of users who are assigned to specific roles in your environment. However,
this user right should explicitly be assigned to the ASPNET account on computers that run
IIS 6.0. You should confirm that delegated activities will not be adversely affected.

### 2.2.20 (L1) Ensure 'Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services' to include 'Guests, Local account' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether users can log on as Remote Desktop clients.
After the baseline workstation is joined to a domain environment, there is no need to
use local accounts to access the workstation from the network. Domain accounts can
access the workstation for administration and end-user processing. This user right
supersedes the Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services user right if an
account is subject to both policies.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Guests, Local account.

**Caution: Configuring a standalone (non-domain-joined) workstation as described above**
may result in an inability to remotely administer the workstation.

**Note: The security identifier Local account is not available in Windows 7 and Windows**
[8.0 unless MSKB 2871997 has been installed.](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2871997)

**Note #2: In all versions of Windows prior to Windows 7, Remote Desktop Services**
was known as Terminal Services, so you should substitute the older term if comparing
against an older OS.

**Rationale:**

Any account with the right to log on through Remote Desktop Services could be used to
log on to the remote console of the computer. If this user right is not restricted to
legitimate users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users
might download and run malicious software that elevates their privileges.

**Impact:**

If you assign the Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services user right to other
groups, you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific administrative
roles in your environment. Accounts that have this user right will be unable to connect to
the computer through either Remote Desktop Services or Remote Assistance. You
should confirm that delegated tasks will not be negatively impacted.

### 2.2.21 (L1) Ensure 'Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation' is set to 'No One' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows users to change the Trusted for Delegation setting on a
computer object in Active Directory. Abuse of this privilege could allow unauthorized
users to impersonate other users on the network.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One.

**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

Misuse of the Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation user
right could allow unauthorized users to impersonate other users on the network. An
attacker could exploit this privilege to gain access to network resources and make it
difficult to determine what has happened after a security incident.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 2.2.22 (L1) Ensure 'Force shutdown from a remote system' is set to 'Administrators' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows users to shut down Windows Vista-based or newer computers
from remote locations on the network. Anyone who has been assigned this user right
can cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, which would make the computer
unavailable to service user requests. Therefore, it is recommended that only highly
trusted administrators be assigned this user right.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

**Rationale:**

Any user who can shut down a computer could cause a DoS condition to occur.
Therefore, this user right should be tightly restricted.

**Impact:**

If you remove the Force shutdown from a remote system user right from the Server
Operators group you could limit the abilities of users who are assigned to specific
administrative roles in your environment. You should confirm that delegated activities
will not be adversely affected.

### 2.2.23 (L1) Ensure 'Generate security audits' is set to 'LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which users or processes can generate audit records in
the Security log.

The recommended state for this setting is: LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE.

**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

An attacker could use this capability to create a large number of audited events, which
would make it more difficult for a system administrator to locate any illicit activity. Also, if
the event log is configured to overwrite events as needed, any evidence of unauthorized
activities could be overwritten by a large number of unrelated events.

**Impact:**

On most computers, this is the default configuration and there will be no negative
impact. However, if you have installed Web Server (IIS), you will need to allow the IIS
application pool(s) to be granted this user right.

### 2.2.24 (L1) Ensure 'Impersonate a client after authentication' is set to 'Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE, SERVICE' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

The policy setting allows programs that run on behalf of a user to impersonate that user
(or another specified account) so that they can act on behalf of the user. If this user right
is required for this kind of impersonation, an unauthorized user will not be able to
convince a client to connect—for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named
pipes—to a service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could
elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.

Services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group
added by default to their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM
infrastructure and configured to run under a specific account also have the Service
group added to their access tokens. As a result, these processes are assigned this user
right when they are started.

Also, a user can impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist:

  - The access token that is being impersonated is for this user.

  - The user, in this logon session, logged on to the network with explicit credentials
to create the access token.

  - The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify.

An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create
a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that
client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK
```
SERVICE, SERVICE.

```
**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

An attacker with the Impersonate a client after authentication user right could create
a service, trick a client to make them connect to the service, and then impersonate that
client to elevate the attacker's level of access to that of the client.

**Impact:**

In most cases this configuration will have no impact. If you have installed Web Server
_(IIS), you will need to also assign the user right to IIS_IUSRS._

### 2.2.25 (L1) Ensure 'Increase scheduling priority' is set to 'Administrators, Window Manager\Window Manager Group' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether users can increase the base priority class of a
process. (It is not a privileged operation to increase relative priority within a priority
class.) This user right is not required by administrative tools that are supplied with the
operating system but might be required by software development tools.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Window Manager\Window
```
Manager Group.

```
**Rationale:**

A user who is assigned this user right could increase the scheduling priority of a
process to Real-Time, which would leave little processing time for all other processes
and could lead to a DoS condition.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 2.2.26 (L1) Ensure 'Load and unload device drivers' is set to 'Administrators' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows users to dynamically load a new device driver on a system. An
attacker could potentially use this capability to install malicious code that appears to be
a device driver. This user right is required for users to add local printers or printer
drivers in Windows Vista.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

Device drivers run as highly privileged code. A user who has the Load and unload
**device drivers user right could unintentionally install malicious code that masquerades**
as a device driver. Administrators should exercise greater care and install only drivers
with verified digital signatures.

**Impact:**

If you remove the Load and unload device drivers user right from the Print
```
Operators group or other accounts you could limit the abilities of users who are

```
assigned to specific administrative roles in your environment. You should ensure that
delegated tasks will not be negatively affected.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```
Administrators:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\User Rights Assignment\Load and unload device drivers

```
**Default Value:**

Administrators.

### 2.2.27 (L1) Ensure 'Lock pages in memory' is set to 'No One' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows a process to keep data in physical memory, which prevents
the system from paging the data to virtual memory on disk. If this user right is assigned,
significant degradation of system performance can occur.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One.

**Rationale:**

Users with the Lock pages in memory user right could assign physical memory to
several processes, which could leave little or no RAM for other processes and result in
a DoS condition.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

### 2.2.28 (L2) Ensure 'Log on as a batch job' is set to 'Administrators' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows accounts to log on using the task scheduler service. Because
the task scheduler is often used for administrative purposes, it may be needed in
enterprise environments. However, its use should be restricted in high security
environments to prevent misuse of system resources or to prevent attackers from using
the right to launch malicious code after gaining user level access to a computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

**Rationale:**

The Log on as a batch job user right presents a low-risk vulnerability. For most
organizations, the default settings are sufficient.

**Impact:**

If you configure the Log on as a batch job setting through domain-based Group
Policies, the computer will not be able to assign the user right to accounts that are used
for scheduled jobs in the Task Scheduler. If you install optional components such as
ASP.NET or IIS, you might need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are
required by those components. For example, IIS requires assignment of this user right
to the IIS_WPG group and the IUSR_(ComputerName), ASPNET, and
```
IWAM_(ComputerName) accounts. If this user right is not assigned to this group and

```
these accounts, IIS will be unable to run some COM objects that are necessary for
proper functionality.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```
Administrators:

### 2.2.29 (L2) Configure 'Log on as a service' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows accounts to launch network services or to register a process
as a service running on the system. This user right should be restricted on any
computer in a high security environment, but because many applications may require
this privilege, it should be carefully evaluated and tested before configuring it in an
enterprise environment. On Windows Vista-based (or newer) computers, no users or
groups have this privilege by default.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One or (when the Hyper-V feature is
installed) NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines or (when using Windows Defender
_Application Guard, such as in the Next Generation Windows Security profile)_
```
WDAGUtilityAccount.

```
**Note: The Hyper-V feature was first introduced on Windows workstations with the 64-bit**
version of Windows 8.0, so the NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines option does not
apply to Windows 7 (or older) versions of Windows. Older OSes should only be
configured for No One.

**Note #2: The Windows Defender Application Guard feature was first introduced on**
Windows workstations with the 64-bit version of Windows 10, so the
```
WDAGUtilityAccount option does not apply to 32-bit versions of Windows.

```
**Rationale:**

**Log on as a service is a powerful user right because it allows accounts to launch**
network services or services that run continuously on a computer, even when no one is
logged on to the console. The risk is reduced by the fact that only users with
administrative privileges can install and configure services. An attacker who has already
attained that level of access could configure the service to run with the Local System
account.

**Impact:**

If you have installed optional components such as ASP.NET or IIS, you may need to
assign the Log on as a service user right to additional accounts that are required by
those components. IIS requires that this user right be explicitly granted to the ASPNET
user account. On Windows Workstations with the Hyper-V feature installed, this user
right should also be granted to the special group NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual
```
Machines.

This policy setting determines which users can change the auditing options for files and
directories and clear the Security log.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

The ability to manage the Security event log is a powerful user right and it should be
closely guarded. Anyone with this user right can clear the Security log to erase
important evidence of unauthorized activity.

### 2.2.34 (L1) Ensure 'Profile single process' is set to 'Administrators' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which users can use tools to monitor the performance of
non-system processes. Typically, you do not need to configure this user right to use the
Microsoft Management Console (MMC) Performance snap-in. However, you do need
this user right if System Monitor is configured to collect data using Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI). Restricting the Profile single process user right
prevents intruders from gaining additional information that could be used to mount an
attack on the system.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

**Rationale:**

The Profile single process user right presents a moderate vulnerability. An attacker
with this user right could monitor a computer's performance to help identify critical
processes that they might wish to attack directly. The attacker may also be able to
determine what processes run on the computer so that they could identify
countermeasures that they may need to avoid, such as antivirus software, an intrusiondetection system, or which other users are logged on to a computer.

### 2.2.36 (L1) Ensure 'Replace a process level token' is set to 'LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows one process or service to start another service or process with
a different security access token, which can be used to modify the security access token
of that sub-process and result in the escalation of privileges.

The recommended state for this setting is: LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE.

**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

Users with the Replace a process level token privilege are able to start processes as
other users whose credentials they know. They could use this method to hide their
unauthorized actions on the computer. (On Windows 2000-based computers, use of the
**Replace a process level token user right also requires the user to have the Adjust**
**memory quotas for a process user right that is discussed earlier in this section.)**

**Impact:**

On most computers, this is the default configuration and there will be no negative
impact. However, if you have installed Web Server (IIS), you will need to allow the IIS
application pool(s) to be granted this User Right Assignment.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 2.2.37 (L1) Ensure 'Restore files and directories' is set to 'Administrators' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which users can bypass file, directory, registry, and other
persistent object permissions when restoring backed up files and directories on
computers that run Windows Vista (or newer) in your environment. This user right also
determines which users can set valid security principals as object owners; it is similar to
the Back up files and directories user right.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

An attacker with the Restore files and directories user right could restore sensitive
data to a computer and overwrite data that is more recent, which could lead to loss of
important data, data corruption, or a denial of service. Attackers could overwrite
executable files that are used by legitimate administrators or system services with
versions that include malicious software to grant themselves elevated privileges,
compromise data, or install backdoors for continued access to the computer.

**Note: Even if the following countermeasure is configured, an attacker could still restore**
data to a computer in a domain that is controlled by the attacker. Therefore, it is critical
that organizations carefully protect the media that is used to back up data.

**Impact:**

If you remove the Restore files and directories user right from the Backup Operators
group and other accounts you could make it impossible for users who have been
delegated specific tasks to perform those tasks. You should verify that this change won't
negatively affect the ability of your organization's personnel to do their jobs.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which users who are logged on locally to the computers
in your environment can shut down the operating system with the Shut Down command.
Misuse of this user right can result in a denial of service condition.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, Users.

**Rationale:**

The ability to shut down a workstation should be available generally to Administrators
and authorized users of that workstation, but not permitted for guests or unauthorized
users - in order to prevent a Denial of Service attack.

**Impact:**

The impact of removing these default groups from the Shut down the system user
right could limit the delegated abilities of assigned roles in your environment. You
should confirm that delegated activities will not be adversely affected.

### 2.2.39 (L1) Ensure 'Take ownership of files or other objects' is set to 'Administrators' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

**Description:**

This policy setting allows users to take ownership of files, folders, registry keys,
processes, or threads. This user right bypasses any permissions that are in place to
protect objects to give ownership to the specified user.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

**Note: This user right is considered a "sensitive privilege" for the purposes of auditing.**

**Rationale:**

Any users with the Take ownership of files or other objects user right can take
control of any object, regardless of the permissions on that object, and then make any
changes they wish to that object. Such changes could result in exposure of data,
corruption of data, or a DoS condition.

### 2.3.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Block Microsoft accounts' is set to 'Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting prevents users from adding new Microsoft accounts on this
computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Users can't add or log on with Microsoft
```
accounts.

```
**Rationale:**

Organizations that want to effectively implement identity management policies and
maintain firm control of what accounts are used to log onto their computers will probably
want to block Microsoft accounts. Organizations may also need to block Microsoft
accounts in order to meet the requirements of compliance standards that apply to their
information systems.

### 2.3.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Guest account status' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether the Guest account is enabled or disabled. The
Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to gain access to the system.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: This setting will have no impact when applied to the Domain Controllers**
organizational unit via group policy because Domain Controllers have no local account
database. It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account
lockout and password policy settings.

**Rationale:**

The default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to log on as Guest
with no password. These unauthorized users could access any resources that are
accessible to the Guest account over the network. This capability means that any
network shares with permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests
group, or the Everyone group will be accessible over the network, which could lead to
the exposure or corruption of data.

**Impact:**

All network users will need to authenticate before they can access shared resources. If
you disable the Guest account and the Network Access: Sharing and Security Model
option is set to Guest Only, network logons, such as those performed by the Microsoft
Network Server (SMB Service), will fail. This policy setting should have little impact on
most organizations because it is the default setting in Microsoft Windows 2000,
Windows XP, and Windows Server™ 2003.

### 2.3.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected
can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If you
enable this policy setting, local accounts that have blank passwords will not be able to
log on to the network from remote client computers. Such accounts will only be able to
log on at the keyboard of the computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden
through both organizational policy and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default
settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven
characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your
domain-based password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For
example, a user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with
blank passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with
blank passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these
unprotected accounts could then use it to log on.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```

### 2.3.1.4 (L1) Configure 'Accounts: Rename administrator account' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

The built-in local administrator account is a well-known account name that attackers will
target. It is recommended to choose another name for this account, and to avoid names
that denote administrative or elevated access accounts. Be sure to also change the
default description for the local administrator (through the Computer Management
console).

**Rationale:**

The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer
operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for
unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.

The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times
an attacker might use a bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account
a popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of
this countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there
are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account
name. Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could
launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on.

**Impact:**

You will have to inform users who are authorized to use this account of the new account
name. (The guidance for this setting assumes that the Administrator account was not
disabled, which was recommended earlier in this chapter.)

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.

### 2.3.1.5 (L1) Configure 'Accounts: Rename guest account' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

The built-in local guest account is another well-known name to attackers. It is
recommended to rename this account to something that does not indicate its purpose.
Even if you disable this account, which is recommended, ensure that you rename it for
added security.

**Rationale:**

The Guest account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer
operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for
unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination.

**Impact:**

There should be little impact, because the Guest account is disabled by default.

### 2.3.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows administrators to enable the more precise auditing capabilities
present in Windows Vista.

The Audit Policy settings available in Windows Server 2003 Active Directory do not yet
contain settings for managing the new auditing subcategories. To properly apply the
auditing policies prescribed in this baseline, the Audit: Force audit policy subcategory
settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings setting needs
to be configured to Enabled.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Important: Be very cautious about audit settings that can generate a large volume of**
traffic. For example, if you enable either success or failure auditing for all of the
Privilege Use subcategories, the high volume of audit events generated can make it
difficult to find other types of entries in the Security log. Such a configuration could also
have a significant impact on system performance.

**Rationale:**

Prior to the introduction of auditing subcategories in Windows Vista, it was difficult to
track events at a per-system or per-user level. The larger event categories created too
many events and the key information that needed to be audited was difficult to find.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 2.3.2.2 (L1) Ensure 'Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log
Security events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria
(TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from
occurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this
requirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system
experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down
if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason.

If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is
enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be
significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to
Do not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation
threat (a backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a
denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it
is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the
Security log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable
damage to the operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS
file system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it
cannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form
when the computer restarts.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

If the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or
important troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security
incident. Also, an attacker could potentially generate a large volume of Security log
events to purposely force a computer shutdown.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 2.3.4.1 (L2) Ensure 'Devices: Prevent users from installing printer drivers' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

For a computer to print to a shared printer, the driver for that shared printer must be
installed on the local computer. This security setting determines who is allowed to install
a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer. This setting does not**
affect Administrators.

**Rationale:**

It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on
their own workstations. However, in a high security environment, you should allow only
Administrators, not users, to do this, because printer driver installation may
unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install
inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user
might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is
feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The
program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could
unleash malicious code on your computer network.

**Impact:**

Only Administrators will be able to install a printer driver as part of connecting to a
shared printer. The ability to add a local printer will not be affected.

### 2.3.6.1 (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always)' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether all secure channel traffic that is initiated by the
domain member must be signed or encrypted.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the
domain, the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel
with the Domain Controller for its domain every time that it restarts. Requests that are
sent on the secure channel are authenticated—and sensitive information such as
passwords are encrypted—but the channel is not integrity-checked, and not all
information is encrypted.

Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea where it is
supported. The secure channel protects domain credentials as they are sent to the
Domain Controller.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior. However, only Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6a
(SP6a) and subsequent versions of the Windows operating system support digital
encryption and signing of the secure channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do
not support it unless they have Dsclient installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the
Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always) setting on
Domain Controllers that support Windows 98 clients as members of the domain.
Potential impacts can include the following:

  - The ability to create or delete trust relationships with clients running versions of
Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled.

  - Logons from clients running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0
with SP6a will be disabled.

  - The ability to authenticate other domains' users from a Domain Controller running
a version of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a in a trusted domain
will be disabled.

You can enable this policy setting after you eliminate all Windows 9x clients from the
domain and upgrade all Windows NT 4.0 servers and Domain Controllers from
trusted/trusting domains to Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a.

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether a domain member should attempt to negotiate

### 2.3.6.3 (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data (when possible)' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether a domain member should attempt to negotiate
whether all secure channel traffic that it initiates must be digitally signed. Digital
signatures protect the traffic from being modified by anyone who captures the data as it
traverses the network.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the
domain, the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel
with the Domain Controller for its domain every time that it restarts. Requests that are
sent on the secure channel are authenticated—and sensitive information such as

### 2.3.6.4 (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Disable machine account password changes' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether a domain member can periodically change its
computer account password. Computers that cannot automatically change their account
passwords are potentially vulnerable, because an attacker might be able to determine
the password for the system's domain account.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: Some problems can occur as a result of machine account password expiration,**
particularly if a machine is reverted to a previous point-in-time state, as is common with
virtual machines. Depending on how far back the reversion is, the older machine
account password stored on the machine may no longer be recognized by the domain
controllers, and therefore the computer loses its domain trust. This can also disrupt nonpersistent VDI implementations, and devices with write filters that disallow permanent
changes to the OS volume. Some organizations may choose to exempt themselves
from this recommendation and disable machine account password expiration for these
situations.

**Rationale:**

The default configuration for Windows Server 2003-based computers that belong to a
domain is that they are automatically required to change the passwords for their
accounts every 30 days. If you disable this policy setting, computers that run Windows
Server 2003 will retain the same passwords as their computer accounts. Computers
that are no longer able to automatically change their account password are at risk from
an attacker who could determine the password for the computer's domain account.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 2.3.6.5 (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Maximum machine account password age' is set to '30 or fewer days, but not 0' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines the maximum allowable age for a computer account
password. By default, domain members automatically change their domain passwords
every 30 days. If you increase this interval significantly so that the computers no longer
change their passwords, an attacker would have more time to undertake a brute force
attack against one of the computer accounts.

The recommended state for this setting is: 30 or fewer days, but not 0.

**Note: A value of 0 does not conform to the benchmark as it disables maximum**
password age.

**Note #2: Some problems can occur as a result of machine account password**
expiration, particularly if a machine is reverted to a previous point-in-time state, as is
common with virtual machines. Depending on how far back the reversion is, the older
machine account password stored on the machine may no longer be recognized by the
domain controllers, and therefore the computer loses its domain trust. This can also
disrupt non-persistent VDI implementations, and devices with write filters that disallow
permanent changes to the OS volume. Some organizations may choose to exempt
themselves from this recommendation and disable machine account password
expiration for these situations.

**Rationale:**

In Active Directory-based domains, each computer has an account and password just
like every user. By default, the domain members automatically change their domain
password every 30 days. If you increase this interval significantly, or set it to 0 so that
the computers no longer change their passwords, an attacker will have more time to
undertake a brute force attack to guess the password of one or more computer
accounts.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 2.3.6.6 (L1) Ensure 'Domain member: Require strong (Windows 2000 or later) session key' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

When this policy setting is enabled, a secure channel can only be established with
Domain Controllers that are capable of encrypting secure channel data with a strong
(128-bit) session key.

To enable this policy setting, all Domain Controllers in the domain must be able to
encrypt secure channel data with a strong key, which means all Domain Controllers
must be running Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Session keys that are used to establish secure channel communications between
Domain Controllers and member computers are much stronger in Windows 2000 than
they were in previous Microsoft operating systems. Whenever possible, you should take
advantage of these stronger session keys to help protect secure channel
communications from attacks that attempt to hijack network sessions and
eavesdropping. (Eavesdropping is a form of hacking in which network data is read or
altered in transit. The data can be modified to hide or change the sender, or be
redirected.)

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior. However, computers will not be able to join Windows
NT 4.0 domains, and trusts between Active Directory domains and Windows NT-style
domains may not work properly.

#### 2.3.7 Interactive logon

This section contains recommendations related to interactive logons.


Page 175

### 2.3.7.1 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they
log on.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Microsoft developed this feature to make it easier for users with certain types of physical
impairments to log on to computers that run Windows. If users are not required to press
CTRL+ALT+DEL, they are susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept their
passwords. If CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before logon, user passwords are
communicated by means of a trusted path.

An attacker could install a Trojan horse program that looks like the standard Windows
logon dialog box and capture the user's password. The attacker would then be able to
log on to the compromised account with whatever level of privilege that user has.

**Impact:**

Users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they log on to Windows unless they use a
smart card for Windows logon. A smart card is a tamper-proof device that stores
security information.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 2.3.7.2 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Don't display last signed-in' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether the account name of the last user to log on to the
client computers in your organization will be displayed in each computer's respective
Windows logon screen. Enable this policy setting to prevent intruders from collecting
account names visually from the screens of desktop or laptop computers in your
organization.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or
someone who is able to connect to the server through Remote Desktop Services) could
view the name of the last user who logged on to the server. The attacker could then try
to guess the password, use a dictionary, or use a brute-force attack to try and log on.

**Impact:**

The name of the last user to successfully log on will not be displayed in the Windows
logon screen.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 2.3.7.3 (BL) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Machine account lockout threshold' is set to '10 or fewer invalid logon attempts, but not 0' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This security setting determines the number of failed logon attempts that causes the
machine to be locked out.

Failed password attempts against workstations or member servers that have been
locked using either CTRL+ALT+DELETE or password protected screen savers counts
as failed logon attempts.

The machine lockout policy is enforced only on those machines that have BitLocker
enabled for protecting OS volumes. Please ensure that appropriate recovery password
backup policies are enabled.

The recommended state for this setting is: 10 or fewer invalid logon attempts, but
```
not 0.

```
**Note: A value of 0 does not conform to the benchmark as it disables the machine**
account lockout threshold. Values from 1 to 3 will be interpreted as 4.

**Rationale:**

If a machine is lost or stolen, or if an insider threat attempts a brute force password
attack against the computer, it is important to ensure that BitLocker will lock the
computer and therefore prevent a successful attack.

**Impact:**

Users will be able to mistype their password several times, but the machine account will
be locked out if a brute force password attack occurs. A locked out machine can only be
recovered by providing the BitLocker recovery key at the console.

### 2.3.7.4 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit' is set to '900 or fewer second(s), but not 0' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Windows notices inactivity of a logon session, and if the amount of inactive time
exceeds the inactivity limit, then the screen saver will run, locking the session.

The recommended state for this setting is: 900 or fewer second(s), but not 0.

**Note: A value of 0 does not conform to the benchmark as it disables the machine**
inactivity limit.

**Rationale:**

If a user forgets to lock their computer when they walk away it's possible that a
passerby will hijack it.

**Impact:**

### 2.3.7.5 (L1) Configure 'Interactive logon: Message text for users attempting to log on' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies a text message that displays to users when they log on. Set
the following group policy to a value that is consistent with the security and operational
requirements of your organization.

**Rationale:**

Displaying a warning message before logon may help prevent an attack by warning the
attacker about the consequences of their misconduct before it happens. It may also help
to reinforce corporate policy by notifying employees of the appropriate policy during the
logon process. This text is often used for legal reasons—for example, to warn users
about the ramifications of misusing company information or to warn them that their
actions may be audited.

**Note: Any warning that you display should first be approved by your organization's legal**
and human resources representatives.

**Impact:**

Users will have to acknowledge a dialog box containing the configured text before they
can log on to the computer.

**Note: Windows Vista and Windows XP Professional support logon banners that can**
exceed 512 characters in length and that can also contain carriage-return line-feed
sequences. However, Windows 2000-based clients cannot interpret and display these
messages. You must use a Windows 2000-based computer to create a logon message
policy that applies to Windows 2000-based computers.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 2.3.7.7 (L2) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)' is set to '4 or fewer logon(s)' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether a user can log on to a Windows domain using
cached account information. Logon information for domain accounts can be cached
locally to allow users to log on even if a Domain Controller cannot be contacted. This
policy setting determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is
cached locally. If this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabled. An attacker
who is able to access the file system of the server could locate this cached information
and use a brute force attack to determine user passwords.

The recommended state for this setting is: 4 or fewer logon(s).

**Rationale:**

The number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose
logon information the computer will cache locally. If the number is set to 4, then the
computer caches logon information for 4 users. When a 5th user logs on to the
computer, the server overwrites the oldest cached logon session.

Users who access the computer console will have their logon credentials cached on that
computer. An attacker who is able to access the file system of the computer could
locate this cached information and use a brute force attack to attempt to determine user
passwords. To mitigate this type of attack, Windows encrypts the information and
obscures its physical location.

**Impact:**

Users will be unable to log on to any computers if there is no Domain Controller
available to authenticate them. Organizations may want to configure this value to 2 for
end-user computers, especially for mobile users. A configuration value of 2 means that
the user's logon information will still be in the cache, even if a member of the IT
department has recently logged on to their computer to perform system maintenance.
This method allows users to log on to their computers when they are not connected to
the organization's network.

### 2.3.7.8 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Prompt user to change password before expiration' is set to 'between 5 and 14 days' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines how far in advance users are warned that their password
will expire. It is recommended that you configure this policy setting to at least 5 days but
no more than 14 days to sufficiently warn users when their passwords will expire.

The recommended state for this setting is: between 5 and 14 days.

**Rationale:**

Users will need to be warned that their passwords are going to expire, or they may
inadvertently be locked out of the computer when their passwords expire. This condition
could lead to confusion for users who access the network locally, or make it impossible
for users to access your organization's network through dial-up or virtual private network
(VPN) connections.

**Impact:**

Users will see a dialog box prompt to change their password each time that they log on
to the domain when their password is configured to expire between 5 and 14 days.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value between 5 and 14.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon:PasswordExpiryWarning

```
**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to a value
```
between 5 and 14 days:

### 2.3.7.9 (L1) Ensure 'Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior' is set to 'Lock Workstation' or higher (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user
is removed from the smart card reader.

The recommended state for this setting is: Lock Workstation. Configuring this setting to
```
Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to

```
the benchmark.

**Rationale:**

Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them,
allowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are
used for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is
removed to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using
those credentials.

**Impact:**

If you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is
removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still
maintain a protected session.

If you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is
removed.

If you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart
card disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert
the smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped
computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy will function
identically to Lock Workstation.

Enforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple
computers in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity.
For example, if network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log
into several computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network
enforcing this setting will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time. For these
reasons it is recommended that this setting only be enforced on workstations used for
purposes commonly associated with typical users such as document creation and
email.

#### 2.3.8 Microsoft network client

This section contains recommendations related to configuring the Microsoft network
client.

Page 194


-----

### 2.3.8.1 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client
component.

**Note: When Windows Vista-based computers have this policy setting enabled and they**
connect to file or print shares on remote servers, it is important that the setting is
synchronized with its companion setting, Microsoft network server: Digitally sign
**communications (always), on those servers. For more information about these**
settings, see the "Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications
(four related settings)" section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network
as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and
forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the
attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain
unauthorized access to data.

SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating
systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures
authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the
authentication process, data transmission will not take place.

Page 195


-----

**Impact:**

The Microsoft network client will not communicate with a Microsoft network server
unless that server agrees to perform SMB packet signing.

The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003,
Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print
sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking
attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB,
which is then verified by both the client and the server.

Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each
packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is
performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain
Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be
substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned
SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to
connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be
vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.

When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows
Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server
2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves
[this issue; see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 950876 for more details: Group Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/950876)
[settings are not applied on member computers that are running Windows Server 2008](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/950876)

### 2.3.8.2 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees)' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether the SMB client will attempt to negotiate SMB
packet signing.

**Note: Enabling this policy setting on SMB clients on your network makes them fully**
effective for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network
as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and
forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the

The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003,
Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print
sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking
attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB,
which is then verified by both the client and the server.

Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each
packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is
performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain
Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be
substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned
SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to
connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be
vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.

When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows
Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server
2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves

### 2.3.8.3 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network client: Send unencrypted password to third-party SMB servers' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether the SMB redirector will send plaintext passwords
during authentication to third-party SMB servers that do not support password
encryption.

It is recommended that you disable this policy setting unless there is a strong business
case to enable it. If this policy setting is enabled, unencrypted passwords will be allowed
across the network.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

If you enable this policy setting, the server can transmit passwords in plaintext across
the network to other computers that offer SMB services, which is a significant security
risk. These other computers may not use any of the SMB security mechanisms that are
included with Windows Server 2003.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 2.3.9.1 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Amount of idle time required before suspending session' is set to '15 or fewer minute(s)' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to specify the amount of continuous idle time that must
pass in an SMB session before the session is suspended because of inactivity.
Administrators can use this policy setting to control when a computer suspends an
inactive SMB session. If client activity resumes, the session is automatically
reestablished.

The maximum value is 99999, which is over 69 days; in effect, this value disables the
setting.

The recommended state for this setting is: 15 or fewer minute(s).

**Rationale:**

Each SMB session consumes server resources, and numerous null sessions will slow
the server or possibly cause it to fail. An attacker could repeatedly establish SMB
sessions until the server's SMB services become slow or unresponsive.

**Impact:**

There will be little impact because SMB sessions will be re-established automatically if
the client resumes activity.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 15 or less.

### 2.3.9.2 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB server
component. Enable this policy setting in a mixed environment to prevent downstream
clients from using the workstation as a network server.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network
as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and
forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the
attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain
unauthorized access to data.

SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating
systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures
authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the
authentication process, data transmission will not take place.

Page 206


-----

**Impact:**

The Microsoft network server will not communicate with a Microsoft network client
unless that client agrees to perform SMB packet signing.

The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003,
Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print
sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking
attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 2.3.9.3 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees)' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether the SMB server will negotiate SMB packet
signing with clients that request it. If no signing request comes from the client, a
connection will be allowed without a signature if the Microsoft network server:
**Digitally sign communications (always) setting is not enabled.**

**Note: Enable this policy setting on SMB clients on your network to make them fully**
effective for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network
as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and

**Impact:**

The Microsoft network server will negotiate SMB packet signing as requested by the

### 2.3.9.4 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Disconnect clients when logon hours expire' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This security setting determines whether to disconnect users who are connected to the
local computer outside their user account's valid logon hours. This setting affects the
Server Message Block (SMB) component. If you enable this policy setting you should
also enable Network security: Force logoff when logon hours expire (Rule 2.3.11.6).

If your organization configures logon hours for users, this policy setting is necessary to
ensure they are effective.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

If your organization configures logon hours for users, then it makes sense to enable this
policy setting. Otherwise, users who should not have access to network resources
outside of their logon hours may actually be able to continue to use those resources
with sessions that were established during allowed hours.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior. If logon hours are not used in your organization, this
policy setting will have no impact. If logon hours are used, existing user sessions will be
forcibly terminated when their logon hours expire.

**Audit:**

### 2.3.9.5 (L1) Ensure 'Microsoft network server: Server SPN target name validation level' is set to 'Accept if provided by client' or higher (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls the level of validation a computer with shared folders or
printers (the server) performs on the service principal name (SPN) that is provided by
the client computer when it establishes a session using the server message block
(SMB) protocol.

The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for file and print sharing
and other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. The SMB
protocol supports validating the SMB server service principal name (SPN) within the
authentication blob provided by a SMB client to prevent a class of attacks against SMB
servers referred to as SMB relay attacks. This setting will affect both SMB1 and SMB2.

The recommended state for this setting is: Accept if provided by client. Configuring
this setting to Required from client also conforms to the benchmark.

**Rationale:**

The identity of a computer can be spoofed to gain unauthorized access to network
resources.

**Impact:**

All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a
server-side SMB component. This setting affects the server SMB behavior, and its
implementation should be carefully evaluated and tested to prevent disruptions to file
and print serving capabilities.

If configured to Accept if provided by client, the SMB server will accept and validate
the SPN provided by the SMB client and allow a session to be established if it matches
the SMB server’s list of SPN’s for itself. If the SPN does NOT match, the session
request for that SMB client will be denied.

If configured to Required from client, the SMB client MUST send a SPN name in
session setup, and the SPN name provided MUST match the SMB server that is being
requested to establish a connection. If no SPN is provided by client, or the SPN
provided does not match, the session is denied.

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether an anonymous user can request security
identifier (SID) attributes for another user, or use a SID to obtain its corresponding user
name.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

If this policy setting is enabled, a user with local access could use the well-known
Administrator's SID to learn the real name of the built-in Administrator account, even if it
has been renamed. That person could then use the account name to initiate a password
guessing attack.

### 2.3.10.2 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls the ability of anonymous users to enumerate the accounts in
the Security Accounts Manager (SAM). If you enable this policy setting, users with
anonymous connections will not be able to enumerate domain account user names on
the systems in your environment. This policy setting also allows additional restrictions
on anonymous connections.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This policy has no effect on Domain Controllers.**

**Rationale:**

An unauthorized user could anonymously list account names and use the information to
attempt to guess passwords or perform social engineering attacks. (Social engineering
attacks try to deceive users in some way to obtain passwords or some form of security
information.)

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior. It will be impossible to establish trusts with Windows
NT 4.0-based domains. Also, client computers that run older versions of the Windows
operating system such as Windows NT 3.51 and Windows 95 will experience problems
when they try to use resources on the server.

### 2.3.10.3 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls the ability of anonymous users to enumerate SAM accounts
as well as shares. If you enable this policy setting, anonymous users will not be able to
enumerate domain account user names and network share names on the systems in
your environment.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This policy has no effect on Domain Controllers.**

**Rationale:**

An unauthorized user could anonymously list account names and shared resources and
use the information to attempt to guess passwords or perform social engineering
attacks. (Social engineering attacks try to deceive users in some way to obtain
passwords or some form of security information.)

**Impact:**

It will be impossible to establish trusts with Windows NT 4.0-based domains. Also, client
computers that run older versions of the Windows operating system such as Windows
NT 3.51 and Windows 95 will experience problems when they try to use resources on
the server. Users who access file and print servers anonymously will be unable to list
the shared network resources on those servers; the users will have to authenticate
before they can view the lists of shared folders and printers. However, even with this
policy setting enabled, anonymous users will have access to resources with
permissions that explicitly include the built-in group, ANONYMOUS LOGON.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

```
```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa:RestrictAnonymous

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```
Enabled:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration
of SAM accounts and shares

```
**Default Value:**

Disabled. (Allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares. No additional
permissions can be assigned by the administrator for anonymous connections to the
computer. Anonymous connections will rely on default permissions.)

### 2.3.10.4 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether Credential Manager (formerly called Stored User
Names and Passwords) saves passwords or credentials for later use when it gains
domain authentication.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: Changes to this setting will not take effect until Windows is restarted.**

**Rationale:**

Passwords that are cached can be accessed by the user when logged on to the
computer. Although this information may sound obvious, a problem can arise if the user
unknowingly executes hostile code that reads the passwords and forwards them to
another, unauthorized user.

**Impact:**

Credential Manager will not store passwords and credentials on the computer. Users
will be forced to enter passwords whenever they log on to their Passport account or
other network resources that aren't accessible to their domain account. Testing has
shown that clients running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 will be unable to
connect to Distributed File System (DFS) shares in untrusted domains. Enabling this
setting also makes it impossible to specify alternate credentials for scheduled tasks, this
can cause a variety of problems. For example, some third-party backup products will no
longer work. This policy setting should have no impact on users who access network
resources that are configured to allow access with their Active Directory-based domain
account.

**Description:**

This policy setting determines what additional permissions are assigned for anonymous
connections to the computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

An unauthorized user could anonymously list account names and shared resources and

### 2.3.10.6 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Named Pipes that can be accessed anonymously' is set to 'None' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which communication sessions, or pipes, will have
attributes and permissions that allow anonymous access.

The recommended state for this setting is: <blank> (i.e. None).

**Rationale:**

Limiting named pipes that can be accessed anonymously will reduce the attack surface
of the system.

**Impact:**

This configuration will disable null session access over named pipes, and applications
that rely on this feature or on unauthenticated access to named pipes will no longer
function.

### 2.3.10.7 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Remotely accessible registry paths' is configured (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which registry paths will be accessible over the network,
regardless of the users or groups listed in the access control list (ACL) of the winreg
registry key.

**Note: This setting does not exist in Windows XP. There was a setting with that name in**
Windows XP, but it is called "Network access: Remotely accessible registry paths and
sub-paths" in Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 (nonR2).

**Note #2: When you configure this setting you specify a list of one or more objects. The**
delimiter used when entering the list is a line feed or carriage return, that is, type the
first object on the list, press the Enter button, type the next object, press Enter again,
etc. The setting value is stored as a comma-delimited list in group policy security
templates. It is also rendered as a comma-delimited list in Group Policy Editor's display
pane and the Resultant Set of Policy console. It is recorded in the registry as a line-feed
delimited list in a REG_MULTI_SZ value.

The recommended state for this setting is:
```
System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions
System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Server Applications
Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion

```
**Rationale:**

The registry is a database that contains computer configuration information, and much
of the information is sensitive. An attacker could use this information to facilitate
unauthorized activities. To reduce the risk of such an attack, suitable ACLs are
assigned throughout the registry to help protect it from access by unauthorized users.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior. However, if you remove the default registry paths
from the list of accessible ones, remote management tools such as the Microsoft
Baseline Security Analyzer and Microsoft Systems Management Server could fail, as
they require remote access to the registry to properly monitor and manage computers.

**Note: If you want to allow remote access, you must also enable the Remote Registry**
service.

### 2.3.10.8 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Remotely accessible registry paths and sub-paths' is configured (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which registry paths and sub-paths will be accessible
over the network, regardless of the users or groups listed in the access control list
(ACL) of the winreg registry key.

**Note: In Windows XP this setting is called "Network access: Remotely accessible**
registry paths," the setting with that same name in Windows Vista, Windows Server
2008 (non-R2), and Windows Server 2003 does not exist in Windows XP.

**Note #2: When you configure this setting you specify a list of one or more objects. The**
delimiter used when entering the list is a line feed or carriage return, that is, type the
first object on the list, press the Enter button, type the next object, press Enter again,
etc. The setting value is stored as a comma-delimited list in group policy security
templates. It is also rendered as a comma-delimited list in Group Policy Editor's display
pane and the Resultant Set of Policy console. It is recorded in the registry as a line-feed
delimited list in a REG_MULTI_SZ value.

The recommended state for this setting is:
```
System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers
System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog
Software\Microsoft\OLAP Server
Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Print
Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows

System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\UserConfig
System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\DefaultUserConfiguration
Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib
System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SysmonLog

```
**Rationale:**

The registry contains sensitive computer configuration information that could be used by
an attacker to facilitate unauthorized activities. The fact that the default ACLs assigned
throughout the registry are fairly restrictive and help to protect the registry from access
by unauthorized users reduces the risk of such an attack.

### 2.3.10.9 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Restrict anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

When enabled, this policy setting restricts anonymous access to only those shares and
pipes that are named in the Network access: Named pipes that can be accessed
```
anonymously and Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously

```
settings. This policy setting controls null session access to shares on your computers by
adding RestrictNullSessAccess with the value 1 in the
```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters

```
registry key. This registry value toggles null session shares on or off to control whether
the server service restricts unauthenticated clients' access to named resources.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Null sessions are a weakness that can be exploited through shares (including the
default shares) on computers in your environment.

Page 234


-----

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior. If you choose to enable this setting and are
supporting Windows NT 4.0 domains, you should check if any of the named pipes are
required to maintain trust relationships between the domains, and then add the pipe to
the Network access: Named pipes that can be accessed anonymously list:

  - COMNAP: SNA session access

  - COMNODE: SNA session access

  - SQL\QUERY: SQL instance access

  - SPOOLSS: Spooler service

  - LLSRPC: License Logging service

  - NETLOGON: Net Logon service

  - LSARPC: LSA access

  - SAMR: Remote access to SAM objects

  - BROWSER: Computer Browser service

Previous to the release of Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) these
named pipes were allowed anonymous access by default, but with the increased
hardening in Windows Server 2003 with SP1 these pipes must be explicitly added if
needed.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```

### 2.3.10.10 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Restrict clients allowed to make remote calls to SAM' is set to 'Administrators: Remote Access: Allow' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to restrict remote RPC connections to SAM.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators: Remote Access: Allow.

**Note: A Windows 10 R1607, Server 2016 or newer OS is required to access and set**
this value in Group Policy.

**Note #2: This setting was originally only supported on Windows 10 R1607 or newer,**
then support for it was added to Windows 7 or newer via the March 2017 security
patches.

**Note #3: If your organization is using Microsoft Defender for Identity (formerly Azure**
Advanced Threat Protection (Azure ATP)), the (organization-named) Defender for
Identity Directory Service Account (DSA), will also need to be granted the same Remote
```
Access: Allow permission. For more information on adding the service account please

**Rationale:**

To ensure that an unauthorized user cannot anonymously list local account names or
groups and use the information to attempt to guess passwords or perform social
engineering attacks. (Social engineering attacks try to deceive users in some way to
obtain passwords or some form of security information.)

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 2.3.10.11 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Shares that can be accessed anonymously' is set to 'None' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which network shares can be accessed by anonymous
users. The default configuration for this policy setting has little effect because all users
have to be authenticated before they can access shared resources on the server.

The recommended state for this setting is: <blank> (i.e. None).

**Rationale:**

It is very dangerous to allow any values in this setting. Any shares that are listed can be
accessed by any network user, which could lead to the exposure or corruption of
sensitive data.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 2.3.10.12 (L1) Ensure 'Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts' is set to 'Classic - local users authenticate as themselves' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are
authenticated. The Classic option allows precise control over access to resources,
including the ability to assign different types of access to different users for the same
resource. The Guest only option allows you to treat all users equally. In this context, all
users authenticate as Guest only to receive the same access level to a given resource.

The recommended state for this setting is: Classic - local users authenticate as
```
themselves.

```
**Note: This setting does not affect interactive logons that are performed remotely by**
using such services as Telnet or Remote Desktop Services (formerly called Terminal
Services).

**Rationale:**

With the Guest only model, any user who can authenticate to your computer over the
network does so with guest privileges, which probably means that they will not have
write access to shared resources on that computer. Although this restriction does
increase security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared
resources on those computers because ACLs on those resources must include access
control entries (ACEs) for the Guest account. With the Classic model, local accounts
should be password protected. Otherwise, if Guest access is enabled, anyone can use
those user accounts to access shared system resources.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default configuration for domain-joined computers.

#### 2.3.11 Network security

This section contains recommendations related to network security.


Page 243


-----

### 2.3.11.1 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Allow Local System to use computer identity for NTLM' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether Local System services that use Negotiate when
reverting to NTLM authentication can use the computer identity. This policy is supported
on at least Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

When connecting to computers running versions of Windows earlier than Windows Vista
or Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), services running as Local System and using
SPNEGO (Negotiate) that revert to NTLM use the computer identity. In Windows 7, if
you are connecting to a computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista,
then a system service uses either the computer identity or a NULL session. When
connecting with a NULL session, a system-generated session key is created, which
provides no protection but allows applications to sign and encrypt data without errors.
When connecting with the computer identity, both signing and encryption is supported in
order to provide data protection.

**Impact:**

Services running as Local System that use Negotiate when reverting to NTLM
authentication will use the computer identity. This might cause some authentication
requests between Windows operating systems to fail and log an error.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

```
```

### 2.3.11.2 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Allow LocalSystem NULL session fallback' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether NTLM is allowed to fall back to a NULL session
when used with LocalSystem.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

NULL sessions are less secure because by definition they are unauthenticated.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior. Any applications that require NULL sessions for
LocalSystem will not work as designed.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```

### 2.3.11.3 (L1) Ensure 'Network Security: Allow PKU2U authentication requests to this computer to use online identities' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting determines if online identities are able to authenticate to this computer.

The Public Key Cryptography Based User-to-User (PKU2U) protocol introduced in
Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 is implemented as a security support provider
(SSP). The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows
7 media and file sharing feature called HomeGroup, which permits sharing between
computers that are not members of a domain.

With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package,
```
Spnego.dll. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use

```
Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll,
which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs
including PKU2U.

When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs,
```
Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U

```
SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers.
When validated on the peer computer, the certificate within the metadata is sent to the
logon peer for validation and associates the user's certificate to a security token and the
logon process completes.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: If a hybrid environment is used, and PKU2U is Disabled, Remote Desktop**
connections from a hybrid joined system to a hybrid joined system will fail.

**Rationale:**

The PKU2U protocol is a peer-to-peer authentication protocol - authentication should be
managed centrally in most managed networks.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default configuration for domain-joined computers.

### 2.3.11.4 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos' is set to 'AES128_HMAC_SHA1, AES256_HMAC_SHA1, Future encryption types' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to set the encryption types that Kerberos is allowed to
use.

The recommended state for this setting is: AES128_HMAC_SHA1, AES256_HMAC_SHA1,
```
Future encryption types.

```
**Note: Some legacy applications and OSes may still require RC4_HMAC_MD5 - we**
recommend you test in your environment and verify whether you can safely remove it.

**Rationale:**

The strength of each encryption algorithm varies from one to the next, choosing
stronger algorithms will reduce the risk of compromise however doing so may cause
issues when the computer attempts to authenticate with systems that do not support
them.

**Impact:**

If not selected, the encryption type will not be allowed. This setting may affect
compatibility with client computers or services and applications. Multiple selections are
permitted.

**Note: Some legacy applications and OSes may still require RC4_HMAC_MD5 - we**
recommend you test in your environment and verify whether you can safely remove it.

**Note #2: Windows Vista and below allow DES for Kerberos by default, but later OS**
versions do not.

**Note #3: Some prerequisites might need to be met on Domain Controllers to support**
Kerberos AES 128 and 256 bit encryption types, as well as enabling support for
Kerberos AES 128 and 256 bit on user accounts (in account options) for this
recommendation to work correctly.

**Note #4: If your organization uses Azure Files, please note that Microsoft did not**
introduce AES 256 Kerberos encryption support for it until AD DS authentication module
v0.2.2. Please see this link for more information:

### 2.3.11.5 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Do not store LAN Manager hash value on next password change' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new
password is stored when the password is changed. The LM hash is relatively weak and
prone to attack compared to the cryptographically stronger Microsoft Windows NT hash.
Since LM hashes are stored on the local computer in the security database, passwords
can then be easily compromised if the database is attacked.

**Note: Older operating systems and some third-party applications may fail when this**
policy setting is enabled. Also, note that the password will need to be changed on all
accounts after you enable this setting to gain the proper benefit.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

The SAM file can be targeted by attackers who seek access to username and password
hashes. Such attacks use special tools to crack passwords, which can then be used to
impersonate users and gain access to resources on your network. These types of
attacks will not be prevented if you enable this policy setting, but it will be much more
difficult for these types of attacks to succeed.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior. Earlier operating systems such as Windows 95,
Windows 98, and Windows ME as well as some third-party applications will fail.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 2.3.11.7 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating
Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single
network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user
security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the
Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos
protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or
NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2
(NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients
when they perform the following operations:

  - Join a domain

  - Authenticate between Active Directory forests

  - Authenticate to down-level domains

  - Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,
or Windows XP

  - Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain

The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which
challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice
affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security
negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM &
```
NTLM.

```
Page 256


-----

**Rationale:**

Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and
NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients
only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server
2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources.
However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that
traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password.

The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the
Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server
2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM
protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication
protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the
logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process.
Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and
servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to
authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these
reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as
possible.

**Impact:**

Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server
supports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2
authentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to
authenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 5.

```
```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa:LmCompatibilityLevel

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to: Send
```
NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Network security: LAN Manager authentication level

```
**Default Value:**

Send NTLMv2 response only. (Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use
NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; Domain Controllers accept LM, NTLM
& NTLMv2 authentication.)

### 2.3.11.8 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: LDAP client signing requirements' is set to 'Negotiate signing' or higher (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines the level of data signing that is requested on behalf of
clients that issue LDAP BIND requests.

**Note: This policy setting does not have any impact on LDAP simple bind**
(ldap_simple_bind) or LDAP simple bind through SSL (ldap_simple_bind_s). No
Microsoft LDAP clients that are included with Windows XP Professional use
```
ldap_simple_bind or ldap_simple_bind_s to communicate with a Domain Controller.

```
The recommended state for this setting is: Negotiate signing. Configuring this setting
to Require signing also conforms to the benchmark.

**Rationale:**

Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder
captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards
them to the server. For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could
cause a server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP
queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security
measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-inthe-middle attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network
packets by means of IPsec authentication headers.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior. However, if you choose instead to configure the
server to require LDAP signatures then you must also configure the client. If you do not
configure the client it will not be able to communicate with the server, which could cause
many features to fail, including user authentication, Group Policy, and logon scripts,
because the caller will be told that the LDAP BIND command request failed.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

```
```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LDAP:LDAPClientIntegrity

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```
Negotiate signing (configuring to Require signing also conforms to the benchmark):
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\Network security: LDAP client signing requirements

```
**Default Value:**

Negotiate signing. (If Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) has not
been started, the LDAP BIND request is initiated with the LDAP data signing option set
in addition to the caller-specified options. If TLS/SSL has been started, the LDAP BIND
request is initiated with the caller-specified options.)

### 2.3.11.9 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients' is set to 'Require NTLMv2 session security, Require 128-bit encryption' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines which behaviors are allowed by clients for applications
using the NTLM Security Support Provider (SSP). The SSP Interface (SSPI) is used by
applications that need authentication services. The setting does not modify how the
authentication sequence works but instead require certain behaviors in applications that
use the SSPI.

The recommended state for this setting is: Require NTLMv2 session security, Require
```
128-bit encryption.

```
**Note: These values are dependent on the Network security: LAN Manager**
_Authentication Level (Rule 2.3.11.7) security setting value._

**Rationale:**

You can enable both options for this policy setting to help protect network traffic that
uses the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLM SSP) from being exposed or
tampered with by an attacker who has gained access to the same network. In other
words, these options help protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact:**

NTLM connections will fail if NTLMv2 protocol and strong encryption (128-bit) are not
**both negotiated. Client applications that are enforcing these settings will be unable to**
communicate with older servers that do not support them.

**Audit:**

### 2.3.11.11 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Restrict NTLM: Audit Incoming NTLM Traffic' is set to 'Enable auditing for all accounts' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows the auditing of incoming NTLM traffic. Events for this setting
are recorded in the operational event log (e.g. Applications and Services
Log\Microsoft\Windows\NTLM).

The recommended state for this setting is: Enable auditing for all accounts.

**Rationale:**

Auditing and monitoring NTLM traffic can assist in identifying systems using this
outdated authentication protocol, so they can be remediated to using a more secure
protocol, such as Kerberos. The log information gathered can also assist in forensic
investigations after a malicious attack.

NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication is vulnerable to various attacks, including SMB relay,
man-in-the-middle, and brute force attacks. Reducing and eliminating NTLM
authentication in an environment reduces the risk of an attacker gaining access to
systems on the network.

**Impact:**

The event log will contain information on incoming NTLM authentication traffic.

### 2.3.11.12 (L1) Ensure 'Network security: Restrict NTLM: Outgoing NTLM traffic to remote servers' is set to 'Audit all' or higher (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows the auditing of outgoing NTLM traffic. Events for this setting
are recorded in the operational event log (e.g. Applications and Services
Log\Microsoft\Windows\NTLM).

The recommended state for this setting is: Audit all. Configuring this setting to Deny
```
All also conforms to the benchmark.

```
**Note: Configuring this setting to Deny All is more secure, however it could have a**
negative impact on applications that still require NTLM. Test carefully before
implementing the Deny All value.

**Rationale:**

Auditing and monitoring NTLM traffic can assist in identifying systems using this
outdated authentication protocol, so they can be remediated to using a more secure
protocol, such as Kerberos. The log information gathered can also assist in forensic
investigations after a malicious attack.

NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication is vulnerable to various attacks, including SMB relay,

### 2.3.14.1 (L2) Ensure 'System cryptography: Force strong key protection for user keys stored on the computer' is set to 'User is prompted when the key is first used' or higher (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether users' private keys (such as their S-MIME keys)
require a password to be used.

The recommended state for this setting is: User is prompted when the key is first
```
used. Configuring this setting to User must enter a password each time they use a
key also conforms to the benchmark.

```
**Rationale:**

If a user's account is compromised or their computer is inadvertently left unsecured the
malicious user can use the keys stored for the user to access protected resources. You
can configure this policy setting so that users must provide a password that is distinct
from their domain password every time they use a key. This configuration makes it more
difficult for an attacker to access locally stored user keys, even if the attacker takes
control of the user's computer and determines their logon password.

**Impact:**

Users will have to enter their password the first time they access a key that is stored on
their computer. For example, if users use an S-MIME certificate to digitally sign their email they will be forced to enter the password for that certificate the first time that they
send a signed e-mail message. For even stronger security, the value User must enter
```
a password each time they use a key can be set, but the overhead that is involved

```
using this configuration may be too high for some organizations.

Microsoft does not recommend enforcing this setting on servers due to the significant
impact on manageability. For example, you may not be able to configure Remote
Desktop Services to use SSL certificates. More information is available in the Windows
[PKI TechNet Blog here: What is a strong key protection in Windows?.](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/pki/2009/06/16/what-is-a-strong-key-protection-in-windows/)

### 2.3.15.1 (L1) Ensure 'System objects: Require case insensitivity for non-Windows subsystems' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether case insensitivity is enforced for all subsystems.
The Microsoft Win32 subsystem is case insensitive. However, the kernel supports case
sensitivity for other subsystems, such as the Portable Operating System Interface for
UNIX (POSIX). Because Windows is case insensitive (but the POSIX subsystem will
support case sensitivity), failure to enforce this policy setting makes it possible for a
user of the POSIX subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file by
using mixed case to label it. Such a situation can block access to these files by another
user who uses typical Win32 tools, because only one of the files will be available.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Because Windows is case-insensitive but the POSIX subsystem will support case
sensitivity, failure to enable this policy setting would make it possible for a user of that
subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file but with a different mix of
upper and lower case letters. Such a situation could potentially confuse users when
they try to access such files from normal Win32 tools because only one of the files will
be available.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

### 2.3.15.2 (L1) Ensure 'System objects: Strengthen default permissions of internal system objects (e.g. Symbolic Links)' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines the strength of the default discretionary access control list
(DACL) for objects. Active Directory maintains a global list of shared system resources,
such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores. In this way, objects can be
located and shared among processes. Each type of object is created with a default
DACL that specifies who can access the objects and what permissions are granted.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

This setting determines the strength of the default DACL for objects. Windows maintains
a global list of shared computer resources so that objects can be located and shared
among processes. Each type of object is created with a default DACL that specifies who
can access the objects and with what permissions.

### 2.3.17.1 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Admin Approval Mode for the Built-in Administrator account' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls the behavior of Admin Approval Mode for the built-in
Administrator account.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is
trying to mitigate is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without
the user or administrator being aware of its activity. An attack vector for these programs
was to discover the password of the account named "Administrator" because that user
account was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows
Vista or newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a default
installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer
are initially set up in one of two ways:

  - If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has
the equivalent permissions as a local administrator.

  - If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are
created. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer
and create one if a local administrator account is warranted.

Once Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled,
but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled.

**Impact:**

The built-in Administrator account uses Admin Approval Mode. Users that log on using
the local Administrator account will be prompted for consent whenever a program
requests an elevation in privilege, just like any other user would.

### 2.3.17.2 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode' is set to 'Prompt for consent on the secure desktop' or higher (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls the behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators.

The recommended state for this setting is: Prompt for consent on the secure
```
desktop. Configuring this setting to Prompt for credentials on the secure desktop

```
also conforms to the benchmark.

**Rationale:**

One of the risks that the UAC feature introduced with Windows Vista is trying to mitigate
is that of malicious software running under elevated credentials without the user or
administrator being aware of its activity. This setting raises awareness to the
administrator of elevated privilege operations and permits the administrator to prevent a
malicious program from elevating its privilege when the program attempts to do so.

**Impact:**

When an operation (including execution of a Windows binary) requires elevation of
privilege, the user is prompted on the secure desktop to select either Permit or Deny. If
the user selects Permit, the operation continues with the user's highest available
privilege.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1 or 2.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System:ConsentPromptB

```
for consent on the secure desktop or Prompt for credentials on the secure
desktop:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local
Policies\Security Options\User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation
prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode

```
**Default Value:**

Prompt for consent for non-Windows binaries. (When an operation for a non-Microsoft
application requires elevation of privilege, the user is prompted on the secure desktop to
select either Permit or Deny. If the user selects Permit, the operation continues with the
user's highest available privilege.)

### 2.3.17.3 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users' is set to 'Automatically deny elevation requests' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls the behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users.

The recommended state for this setting is: Automatically deny elevation requests.

**Rationale:**

One of the risks that the User Account Control feature introduced with Windows Vista is
trying to mitigate is that of malicious programs running under elevated credentials
without the user or administrator being aware of their activity. This setting raises
awareness to the user that a program requires the use of elevated privilege operations
and requires that the user be able to supply administrative credentials in order for the
program to run.

**Impact:**

When an operation requires elevation of privilege, a configurable access denied error
message is displayed. An enterprise that is running desktops as standard user may
choose this setting to reduce help desk calls.

**Note: With this setting configured as recommended, the default error message**
displayed when a user attempts to perform an operation or run a program requiring
privilege elevation (without Administrator rights) is "This program will not run. This
_program is blocked by group policy. For more information, contact your system_
_administrator." Some users who are not used to seeing this message may believe that_
the operation or program they attempted to run is specifically blocked by group policy,
as that is what the message seems to imply. This message may therefore result in user
questions as to why that specific operation/program is blocked, when in fact, the
problem is that they need to perform the operation or run the program with an
Administrative account (or "Run as Administrator" if it is already an Administrator
account), and they are not doing that.

### 2.3.17.4 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Detect application installations and prompt for elevation' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls the behavior of application installation detection for the
computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Some malicious software will attempt to install itself after being given permission to run.
For example, malicious software with a trusted application shell. The user may have
given permission for the program to run because the program is trusted, but if they are
then prompted for installation of an unknown component this provides another way of
trapping the software before it can do damage

**Impact:**

When an application installation package is detected that requires elevation of privilege,
the user is prompted to enter an administrative user name and password. If the user
enters valid credentials, the operation continues with the applicable privilege.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

### 2.3.17.5 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Only elevate UIAccess applications that are installed in secure locations' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether applications that request to run with a User Interface
Accessibility (UIAccess) integrity level must reside in a secure location in the file
system. Secure locations are limited to the following:

  - `…\Program Files\, including subfolders`

  - `…\Windows\System32\`

  - `…\Program Files (x86)\, including subfolders (for 64-bit versions of Windows)`

**Note: Windows enforces a public key infrastructure (PKI) signature check on any**
interactive application that requests to run with a UIAccess integrity level regardless of
the state of this security setting.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

UIAccess Integrity allows an application to bypass User Interface Privilege Isolation
(UIPI) restrictions when an application is elevated in privilege from a standard user to an
administrator. This is required to support accessibility features such as screen readers
that are transmitting user interfaces to alternative forms. A process that is started with
UIAccess rights has the following abilities:

  - To set the foreground window.

  - To drive any application window using SendInput function.

  - To use read input for all integrity levels using low-level hooks, raw input,
GetKeyState, GetAsyncKeyState, and GetKeyboardInput.

  - To set journal hooks.

  - To uses AttachThreadInput to attach a thread to a higher integrity input queue.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 2.3.17.6 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls the behavior of all User Account Control (UAC) policy
settings for the computer. If you change this policy setting, you must restart your
computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: If this policy setting is disabled, the Security Center notifies you that the overall**
security of the operating system has been reduced.

**Rationale:**

This is the setting that turns on or off UAC. If this setting is disabled, UAC will not be
used and any security benefits and risk mitigations that are dependent on UAC will not
be present on the system.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior. Users and administrators will need to learn to work
with UAC prompts and adjust their work habits to use least privilege operations.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

```
```

### 2.3.17.7 (L1) Ensure 'User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether the elevation request prompt is displayed on the
interactive user's desktop or the secure desktop.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Standard elevation prompt dialog boxes can be spoofed, which may cause users to
disclose their passwords to malicious software. The secure desktop presents a very
distinct appearance when prompting for elevation, where the user desktop dims, and
the elevation prompt UI is more prominent. This increases the likelihood that users who
become accustomed to the secure desktop will recognize a spoofed elevation prompt
dialog box and not fall for the trick.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System:PromptOnSecure

```
**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether application write failures are redirected to defined
registry and file system locations. This policy setting mitigates applications that run as

### 5.1 (L2) Ensure 'Bluetooth Audio Gateway Service (BTAGService)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

Service supporting the audio gateway role of the Bluetooth Handsfree Profile.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Bluetooth technology has inherent security risks - especially prior to the v2.1 standard.
Wireless Bluetooth traffic is not well encrypted (if at all), so in a high-security
environment, it should not be permitted, in spite of the added inconvenience of not
being able to use Bluetooth devices.

**Impact:**

Bluetooth hands-free devices will not function properly with the computer.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 4.

```
```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\BTAGService:Start

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to:
```
Disabled:

Services\Bluetooth Audio Gateway Service

```
**Note: This service was first introduced in Windows 10 Release 1803. It appears to have**
replaced the older Bluetooth Handsfree Service (BthHFSrv), which was removed from
Windows in that release (it is not simply a rename, but a different service).

### 5.2 (L2) Ensure 'Bluetooth Support Service (bthserv)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

The Bluetooth service supports discovery and association of remote Bluetooth devices.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Bluetooth technology has inherent security risks - especially prior to the v2.1 standard.
Wireless Bluetooth traffic is not well encrypted (if at all), so in a high-security
environment, it should not be permitted, in spite of the added inconvenience of not
being able to use Bluetooth devices.

**Impact:**

Already installed Bluetooth devices may fail to operate properly and new devices may
be prevented from being discovered or associated. If Bluetooth devices were installed,
then some Windows components, such as Devices and Printers, may fail to operate
correctly - including hanging/freezing when opened. The solution, besides re-enabling
this service, is to disable or delete the offending Bluetooth device(s) in Device Manager,
or disable the device altogether via the system BIOS (if it is an on-board Bluetooth
device).

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 4.

```
```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bthserv:Start

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to:
```
Disabled.
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\System
Services\Bluetooth Support Service

```
**Default Value:**

Windows 7: Manual

Windows 8.0 or newer: Manual (Trigger Start)

### 5.3 (L1) Ensure 'Computer Browser (Browser)' is set to 'Disabled' or 'Not Installed' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Maintains an updated list of computers on the network and supplies this list to
computers designated as browsers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed.

**Note: In Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, this service is bundled with the SMB 1.0/CIFS**
_File Sharing Support optional feature. As a result, removing that feature (highly_
recommended unless backward compatibility is needed to XP/2003 and older Windows
[OSes - see Stop using SMB1 | Storage at Microsoft) will also remediate this](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/filecab/2016/09/16/stop-using-smb1/)
recommendation. The feature is not installed by default starting with Windows 10
R1709.

**Rationale:**

This is a legacy service - its sole purpose is to maintain a list of computers and their
network shares in the environment (i.e. "Network Neighborhood"). If enabled, it
generates a lot of unnecessary traffic, including "elections" to see who gets to be the
"master browser". This noisy traffic could also aid malicious attackers in discovering
online machines, because the service also allows anyone to "browse" for shared
resources without any authentication. This service used to be running by default in older
Windows versions (e.g. Windows XP), but today it only remains for backward
compatibility for very old software that requires it.

**Impact:**

The list of computers and their shares on the network will not be updated or maintained.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 4 or that the key does not exist.

```
```

### 5.4 (L2) Ensure 'Downloaded Maps Manager (MapsBroker)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

Windows service for application access to downloaded maps. This service is started ondemand by application accessing downloaded maps.

**Rationale:**

Mapping technologies can unwillingly reveal your location to attackers and other
software that picks up the information. In addition, automatic downloads of data from
third-party sources should be minimized when not needed. Therefore, this service
should not be needed in high security environments.

**Impact:**

Applications will be prevented from accessing maps data.

### 5.5 (L2) Ensure 'Geolocation Service (lfsvc)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This service monitors the current location of the system and manages geofences (a
geographical location with associated events).

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

This setting affects the location feature (e.g. GPS or other location tracking). From a
security perspective, it’s not a good idea to reveal your location to software in most
cases, but there are legitimate uses, such as mapping software. However, they should
not be used in high security environments.

**Impact:**

Applications will be unable to use or receive notifications for geolocation or geofences.

### 5.6 (L1) Ensure 'IIS Admin Service (IISADMIN)' is set to 'Disabled' or 'Not Installed' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Enables the server to administer the IIS metabase. The IIS metabase stores
configuration for the SMTP and FTP services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed.

**Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed**
by enabling an optional Windows feature (Internet Information Services).

**Note #2: An organization may choose to selectively grant exceptions to web developers**
to allow IIS (or another web server) on their workstation, in order for them to locally test
& develop web pages. However, the organization should track those machines and
ensure the security controls and mitigations are kept up to date, to reduce risk of
compromise.

**Rationale:**

Hosting a website from a workstation is an increased security risk, as the attack surface
of that workstation is then greatly increased. If proper security mitigations are not
followed, the chance of successful attack increases significantly.

**Note: This security concern applies to any web server application installed on a**
workstation, not just IIS.

**Impact:**

IIS will not function, including Web, SMTP or FTP services.

### 5.7 (L1) Ensure 'Infrared monitor service (irmon)' is set to 'Disabled' or 'Not Installed' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Detects other Infrared devices that are in range and launches the file transfer
application.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed.

**Rationale:**

Infrared connections can potentially be a source of data compromise - especially via the
automatic "file transfer application" functionality. Enterprise-managed systems should
utilize a more secure method of connection than infrared.

**Impact:**

Infrared file transfers will be prevented from working.

**Description:**

Creates a Network Map, consisting of PC and device topology (connectivity)
information, and metadata describing each PC and device.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

The feature that this service enables could potentially be used for unauthorized
discovery and connection to network devices. Disabling the service helps to prevent
responses to requests for network topology discovery in high security environments.

### 5.9 (L1) Ensure 'LxssManager (LxssManager)' is set to 'Disabled' or 'Not Installed' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

The LXSS Manager service supports running native ELF binaries. The service provides
the infrastructure necessary for ELF binaries to run on Windows.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed.

**Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed**
by enabling an optional Windows feature (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

**Rationale:**

The Linux Subsystem (LXSS) Manager allows full system access to Linux applications
on Windows, including the file system. While this can certainly have some functionality
and performance benefits for running those applications, it also creates new security
risks in the event that a hacker injects malicious code into a Linux application. For best
security, it is preferred to run Linux applications on Linux, and Windows applications on
Windows.

**Impact:**

The Linux Subsystem will not be available, and native ELF binaries will no longer run.

**Note: If your organization has made an exception to this recommendation and is using**
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), the Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)
(SharedAccess) service will need to be Enabled for WSL to function. For more
[information, please visit the following Microsoft Blog: Troubleshooting Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting#wsl-2-errors-when-ics-is-disabled)

### 5.11 (L2) Ensure 'Microsoft iSCSI Initiator Service (MSiSCSI)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

Manages Internet SCSI (iSCSI) sessions from this computer to remote target devices.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

This service is critically necessary in order to directly attach to an iSCSI device.
However, iSCSI itself uses a very weak authentication protocol (CHAP), which means
that the passwords for iSCSI communication are easily exposed, unless all of the traffic
is isolated and/or encrypted using another technology like IPsec. This service is
generally more appropriate for servers in a controlled environment then on workstations
requiring high security.

### 5.26 (L2) Ensure 'Server (LanmanServer)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

Supports file, print, and named-pipe sharing over the network for this computer. If this
service is stopped, these functions will be unavailable.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

In a high security environment, a secure workstation should only be a client, not a
server. Sharing workstation resources for remote access increases security risk as the
attack surface is notably higher.

**Impact:**

File, print and named-pipe sharing functions will be unavailable from this machine over
the network.

**Note: Many remote administration tools, such as System Center Configuration Manager**
(SCCM), require the Server service to be operational for remote management. In
addition, many vulnerability scanners use this service to scan the file system remotely.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 4.

```
```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer:Start

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to:
```
Disabled.
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\System
Services\Server

```
**Default Value:**

Windows 7 through Windows 10 R1703: Automatic

### 5.29 (L1) Ensure 'Special Administration Console Helper (sacsvr)' is set to 'Disabled' or 'Not Installed' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This service allows administrators to remotely access a command prompt using
Emergency Management Services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed.

**Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but it is**
installed by enabling an optional Windows capability (Windows Emergency
_Management Services and Serial Console)._

**Rationale:**

Allowing the use of a remotely accessible command prompt that provides the ability to
perform remote management tasks on a computer is a security risk.

**Impact:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Discovers networked devices and services that use the SSDP discovery protocol, such
as UPnP devices. Also announces SSDP devices and services running on the local
computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Universal Plug n Play (UPnP) is a real security risk - it allows automatic discovery and
attachment to network devices. Note that UPnP is different than regular Plug n Play
(PnP). Workstations should not be advertising their services (or automatically
discovering and connecting to networked services) in a security-conscious enterprise
managed environment.

**Impact:**

SSDP-based devices will not be discovered.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Universal Plug n Play (UPnP) is a real security risk - it allows automatic discovery and
attachment to network devices. Notes that UPnP is different than regular Plug n Play
(PnP). Workstations should not be advertising their services (or automatically

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed.

**Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed**
by enabling an optional Windows feature (Internet Information Services - Web
_Management Tools - IIS Management Service)._

**Rationale:**

Remote web administration of IIS on a workstation is an increased security risk, as the
attack surface of that workstation is then greatly increased. If proper security mitigations
are not followed, the chance of successful attack increases significantly.

**Impact:**

Remote web-based management of IIS will not be available.

### 5.33 (L2) Ensure 'Windows Error Reporting Service (WerSvc)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

Allows errors to be reported when programs stop working or responding and allows
existing solutions to be delivered. Also allows logs to be generated for diagnostic and
repair services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

If a Windows Error occurs in a secure, enterprise managed environment, the error
should be reported directly to IT staff for troubleshooting and remediation. There is no
benefit to the corporation to report these errors directly to Microsoft, and there is some
risk of unknowingly exposing sensitive data as part of the error.

**Impact:**

If this service is stopped, error reporting might not work correctly and results of
diagnostic services and repairs might not be displayed.

### 5.34 (L2) Ensure 'Windows Event Collector (Wecsvc)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This service manages persistent subscriptions to events from remote sources that
support WS-Management protocol. This includes Windows Vista event logs, hardware
and IPMI-enabled event sources. The service stores forwarded events in a local Event
Log.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

In a high security environment, remote connections to secure workstations should be
minimized, and management functions should be done locally.

**Impact:**

If this service is stopped or disabled event subscriptions cannot be created and
forwarded events cannot be accepted.

**Description:**

This service manages Apps that are pushed to the device from the Microsoft Store App
running on other devices or the web.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

In a high security managed environment, application installations should be managed
centrally by IT staff, not by end users.

**Impact:**

Users will not be able to push Apps to this device from the Microsoft Store running on
other devices or the web.

### 5.39 (L2) Ensure 'Windows Remote Management (WS- Management) (WinRM)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service implements the WS-Management
protocol for remote management. WS-Management is a standard web services protocol
used for remote software and hardware management. The WinRM service listens on
the network for WS-Management requests and processes them.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Features that enable inbound network connections increase the attack surface. In a
high security environment, management of secure workstations should be handled
locally.

**Impact:**

The ability to remotely manage the system with WinRM will be lost.

**Note: Many remote administration tools, such as System Center Configuration Manager**
(SCCM), may require the WinRM service to be operational for remote management.

### 5.40 (L1) Ensure 'World Wide Web Publishing Service (W3SVC)' is set to 'Disabled' or 'Not Installed' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Provides Web connectivity and administration through the Internet Information Services
Manager.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled or Not Installed.

**Note: This service is not installed by default. It is supplied with Windows, but is installed**
by enabling an optional Windows feature (Internet Information Services - World Wide
_Web Services)._

**Note #2: An organization may choose to selectively grant exceptions to web developers**
to allow IIS (or another web server) on their workstation, in order for them to locally test
& develop web pages. However, the organization should track those machines and
ensure the security controls and mitigations are kept up to date, to reduce risk of
compromise.

**Rationale:**

Hosting a website from a workstation is an increased security risk, as the attack surface
of that workstation is then greatly increased. If proper security mitigations are not
followed, the chance of successful attack increases significantly.

**Note: This security concern applies to any web server application installed on a**
workstation, not just IIS.

**Impact:**

IIS Web Services will not function.

### 9.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Domain: Firewall state' is set to 'On (recommended)' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Select On (recommended) to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security use the
settings for this profile to filter network traffic. If you select Off, Windows Firewall with
Advanced Security will not use any of the firewall rules or connection security rules for
this profile.

The recommended state for this setting is: On (recommended).

### 9.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Domain: Settings: Display a notification' is set to 'No' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Select this option to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security display notifications
to the user when a program is blocked from receiving inbound connections.

The recommended state for this setting is: No.

**Note: When the Apply local firewall rules setting is configured to No, it's**
recommended to also configure the Display a notification setting to No. Otherwise,
users will continue to receive messages that ask if they want to unblock a restricted
inbound connection, but the user's response will be ignored.

**Rationale:**

Firewall notifications can be complex and may confuse the end users, who would not be
able to address the alert.

**Impact:**

Windows Firewall will not display a notification when a program is blocked from
receiving inbound connections.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 9.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Domain: Logging: Name' is set to '%SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\domainfw.log' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Use this option to specify the path and name of the file in which Windows Firewall will
write its log information.

The recommended state for this setting is:
```
%SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\domainfw.log.

```
**Rationale:**

If Windows Firewall events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible for
Administrators to analyze system issues or unauthorized activities of malicious users.

Microsoft stores all firewall events as one file on the system (pfirewall.log). To
improve logging, separate each firewall profile (domain, private, public) into its own
distinct log file (domainfw.log, privatefw.log, publicfw.log) for better organization and
identification of specific issues within each profile.

**Impact:**

The log file will be stored in the specified file.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```

**Description:**

This setting determines the behavior for inbound connections that do not match an
inbound firewall rule.

The recommended state for this setting is: Block (default).

**Rationale:**

### 9.2.3 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Private: Settings: Display a notification' is set to 'No' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Select this option to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security display notifications
to the user when a program is blocked from receiving inbound connections.

The recommended state for this setting is: No.

**Note: When the Apply local firewall rules setting is configured to No, it's**
recommended to also configure the Display a notification setting to No. Otherwise,
users will continue to receive messages that ask if they want to unblock a restricted
inbound connection, but the user's response will be ignored.

**Rationale:**

Firewall notifications can be complex and may confuse the end users, who would not be
able to address the alert.

**Impact:**

Windows Firewall will not display a notification when a program is blocked from
receiving inbound connections.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 9.2.4 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Private: Logging: Name' is set to '%SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\privatefw.log' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Use this option to specify the path and name of the file in which Windows Firewall will
write its log information.

The recommended state for this setting is:
```
%SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\privatefw.log.

```
**Rationale:**

If Windows Firewall events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible for
Administrators to analyze system issues or unauthorized activities of malicious users.

Microsoft stores all firewall events as one file on the system (pfirewall.log). To
improve logging, separate each firewall profile (domain, private, public) into its own
distinct log file (domainfw.log, privatefw.log, publicfw.log) for better organization and
identification of specific issues within each profile.

**Impact:**

The log file will be stored in the specified file.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

**Description:**

Select this option to have Windows Firewall with Advanced Security display notifications
to the user when a program is blocked from receiving inbound connections.

The recommended state for this setting is: No.

**Rationale:**

Some organizations may prefer to avoid alarming users when firewall rules block certain
types of network activity. However, notifications can be helpful when troubleshooting
network issues involving the firewall.

**Impact:**

Windows Firewall will not display a notification when a program is blocked from
receiving inbound connections.

### 9.3.4 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Public: Settings: Apply local firewall rules' is set to 'No' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting controls whether local administrators are allowed to create local firewall
rules that apply together with firewall rules configured by Group Policy.

The recommended state for this setting is: No.

**Note: When the Apply local firewall rules setting is configured to No, it's**
recommended to also configure the Display a notification setting to No. Otherwise,
users will continue to receive messages that ask if they want to unblock a restricted
inbound connection, but the user's response will be ignored.

**Rationale:**

When in the Public profile, there should be no special local firewall exceptions per
computer. These settings should be managed by a centralized policy.

**Impact:**

Administrators can still create firewall rules, but the rules will not be applied.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 9.3.6 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Public: Logging: Name' is set to '%SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\publicfw.log' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Use this option to specify the path and name of the file in which Windows Firewall will
write its log information.

The recommended state for this setting is:
```
%SystemRoot%\System32\logfiles\firewall\publicfw.log.

```
**Rationale:**

If Windows Firewall events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible for
Administrators to analyze system issues or unauthorized activities of malicious users.

Microsoft stores all firewall events as one file on the system (pfirewall.log). To
improve logging, separate each firewall profile (domain, private, public) into its own
distinct log file (domainfw.log, privatefw.log, publicfw.log) for better organization and
identification of specific issues within each profile.

**Impact:**

The log file will be stored in the specified file.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 9.3.9 (L1) Ensure 'Windows Firewall: Public: Logging: Log successful connections' is set to 'Yes' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Use this option to log when Windows Firewall with Advanced Security allows an
inbound connection. The log records why and when the connection was formed. Look
for entries with the word ALLOW in the action column of the log.

The recommended state for this setting is: Yes.

**Rationale:**

If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of
system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users.

**Impact:**

Information about successful connections will be recorded in the firewall log file.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\PublicProfile\Logging:LogSuc
cessfulConnections

```
**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Yes.
```
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Windows
Defender Firewall with Advanced Security\Windows Defender Firewall with
Advanced Security\Windows Firewall Properties\Public Profile\Logging
Customize\Log successful connections

```
**Default Value:**

No (default). (Information about successful connections will not be recorded in the
firewall log file.)

### 17.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Credential Validation' is set to 'Success and Failure' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This subcategory reports the results of validation tests on credentials submitted for a
user account logon request. These events occur on the computer that is authoritative for
the credentials. For domain accounts, the Domain Controller is authoritative, whereas
for local accounts, the local computer is authoritative. In domain environments, most of
the Account Logon events occur in the Security log of the Domain Controllers that are
authoritative for the domain accounts. However, these events can occur on other
computers in the organization when local accounts are used to log on. Events for this
subcategory include:

  - 4774: An account was mapped for logon.

  - 4775: An account could not be mapped for logon.

  - 4776: The Domain Controller attempted to validate the credentials for an
account.

  - 4777: The Domain Controller failed to validate the credentials for an account.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.

**Rationale:**

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

**Impact:**

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in
your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will
be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if
audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be
obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available
amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain
regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

### 17.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Application Group Management' is set to 'Success and Failure' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by changes to application
groups such as the following:

  - Application group is created, changed, or deleted.

  - Member is added or removed from an application group.

Application groups are utilized by Windows Authorization Manager, which is a flexible
framework created by Microsoft for integrating role-based access control (RBAC) into
[applications. More information on Windows Authorization Manager is available at MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb897401.aspx)

[- Windows Authorization Manager.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb897401.aspx)

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.

**[Note: Although Microsoft "Deprecated" Windows Authorization Manager (AzMan) in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/feature-lifecycle#terminology)**
Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2, this feature still exists in the OS (unimproved), and
therefore should still be audited.

**Rationale:**

Auditing events in this category may be useful when investigating an incident.

**Impact:**

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in
your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will
be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if
audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be
obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available
amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain

### 17.5.2 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Group Membership' is set to include 'Success' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy allows you to audit the group membership information in the user’s logon
token. Events in this subcategory are generated on the computer on which a logon
session is created. For an interactive logon, the security audit event is generated on the
computer that the user logged on to. For a network logon, such as accessing a shared
folder on the network, the security audit event is generated on the computer hosting the
resource.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success.

**Note: A Windows 10, Server 2016 or newer OS is required to access and set this value**
in Group Policy.

**Rationale:**

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

**Impact:**

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in
your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will
be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if
audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be
obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available
amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain

### 17.5.3 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Logoff' is set to include 'Success' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This subcategory reports when a user logs off from the system. These events occur on
the accessed computer. For interactive logons, the generation of these events occurs
on the computer that is logged on to. If a network logon takes place to access a share,
these events generate on the computer that hosts the accessed resource. If you
configure this setting to No auditing, it is difficult or impossible to determine which user
has accessed or attempted to access organization computers. Events for this
subcategory include:

  - 4634: An account was logged off.

  - 4647: User initiated logoff.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Success.

**Rationale:**

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

**Impact:**

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in
your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will
be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if

### 17.6.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Detailed File Share' is set to include 'Failure' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This subcategory allows you to audit attempts to access files and folders on a shared
folder. Events for this subcategory include:

  - 5145: network share object was checked to see whether client can be granted
desired access.

The recommended state for this setting is to include: Failure

**Rationale:**

Auditing the Failures will log which unauthorized users attempted (and failed) to get
access to a file or folder on a network share on this computer, which could possibly be
an indication of malicious intent.

**Impact:**

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in
your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will
be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if
audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be

### 17.6.2 (L1) Ensure 'Audit File Share' is set to 'Success and Failure' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to audit attempts to access a shared folder.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.

**Note: There are no system access control lists (SACLs) for shared folders. If this policy**
setting is enabled, access to all shared folders on the system is audited.

**Rationale:**

In an enterprise managed environment, workstations should have limited file sharing
activity, as file servers would normally handle the overall burden of file sharing activities.
Any unusual file sharing activity on workstations may therefore be useful in an
investigation of potentially malicious activity.

**Impact:**

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in
your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will
be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if
audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be
obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available
amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain
regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

### 17.6.3 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Other Object Access Events' is set to 'Success and Failure' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to audit events generated by the management of task
scheduler jobs or COM+ objects.

For scheduler jobs, the following are audited:

  - Job created.

  - Job deleted.

  - Job enabled.

  - Job disabled.

  - Job updated.

For COM+ objects, the following are audited:

  - Catalog object added.

  - Catalog object updated.

  - Catalog object deleted.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.

**Rationale:**

The unexpected creation of scheduled tasks and COM+ objects could potentially be an
indication of malicious activity. Since these types of actions are generally low volume, it
may be useful to capture them in the audit logs for use during an investigation.

**Impact:**

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in
your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will
be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if
audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be
obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available
amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain
regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

### 17.6.4 (L1) Ensure 'Audit Removable Storage' is set to 'Success and Failure' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to audit user attempts to access file system objects on a
removable storage device. A security audit event is generated only for all objects for all
types of access requested. If you configure this policy setting, an audit event is
generated each time an account accesses a file system object on a removable storage.
Success audits record successful attempts and Failure audits record unsuccessful
attempts. If you do not configure this policy setting, no audit event is generated when an
account accesses a file system object on a removable storage.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.

**Note: A Windows 8.0, Server 2012 (non-R2) or newer OS is required to access and set**
this value in Group Policy.

**Rationale:**

Auditing removable storage may be useful when investigating an incident. For example,
if an individual is suspected of copying sensitive information onto a USB drive.

**Impact:**

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in
your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will
be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if
audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be
obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available
amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain
regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

### 17.9.1 (L1) Ensure 'Audit IPsec Driver' is set to 'Success and Failure' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This subcategory reports on the activities of the Internet Protocol security (IPsec) driver.
Events for this subcategory include:

  - 4960: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this
problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being
modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote
computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also
indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.

  - 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem
persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.

  - 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound
packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.

  - 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been
secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy
without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.

  - 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security
Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is
corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the
remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error
may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In
that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.

  - 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully.

  - 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec
Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the
computer to potential security risks.

  - 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the
computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network
interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters. Use
the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.

  - 5483: IPsec Services failed to initialize RPC server. IPsec Services could not be
started.

  - 5484: IPsec Services has experienced a critical failure and has been shut down.
The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network
attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.

  - 5485: IPsec Services failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play
event for network interfaces. This poses a potential security risk because some
of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied
IPsec filters. Use the IP Security Monitor snap-in to diagnose the problem.

The recommended state for this setting is: Success and Failure.

**Rationale:**

Auditing these events may be useful when investigating a security incident.

**Impact:**

If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in
your organization, security incidents might not be detected or not enough evidence will
be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if
audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be
obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available
amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain
regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed.
_OR_

### 18.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logons' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting controls whether local accounts can be used for remote administration via
network logon (e.g., NET USE, connecting to C$, etc.). Local accounts are at high risk
for credential theft when the same account and password is configured on multiple
systems. Enabling this policy significantly reduces that risk.

**Enabled: Applies UAC token-filtering to local accounts on network logons. Membership**
in powerful group such as Administrators is disabled and powerful privileges are
removed from the resulting access token. This configures the
```
LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 0. This is the default behavior for

```
Windows.

**Disabled: Allows local accounts to have full administrative rights when authenticating**
via network logon, by configuring the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to
```
1.

```
[For more information about local accounts and credential theft, review the "Mitigating](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36036)
[Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks and Other Credential Theft Techniques" documents.](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36036)

For more information about LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy, see Microsoft Knowledge
[Base article 951016: Description of User Account Control and remote restrictions in](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/951016)
[Windows Vista.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/951016)

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Local accounts are at high risk for credential theft when the same account and
password is configured on multiple systems. Ensuring this policy is Enabled significantly
reduces that risk.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 18.4.3 (L1) Ensure 'Configure SMB v1 client driver' is set to 'Enabled: Disable driver (recommended)' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting configures the start type for the Server Message Block version 1 (SMBv1)
client driver service (MRxSmb10), which is recommended to be disabled.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Disable driver (recommended).

**Note: Do not, under any circumstances, configure this overall setting as Disabled, as**
doing so will delete the underlying registry entry altogether, which will cause serious
problems.

**Rationale:**

Since September 2016, Microsoft has strongly encouraged that SMBv1 be disabled and
no longer used on modern networks, as it is a 30 year old design that is much more
vulnerable to attacks then much newer designs such as SMBv2 and SMBv3.

[Disabling SMBv1 through Group Policy – Microsoft Security Guidance blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/secguide/2017/06/15/disabling-smbv1-through-group-policy/)

**Impact:**

Some legacy OSes (e.g. Windows XP, Server 2003 or older), applications and
appliances may no longer be able to communicate with the system once SMBv1 is
disabled. We recommend careful testing be performed to determine the impact prior to
configuring this as a widespread control, and where possible, remediate any
incompatibilities found with the vendor of the incompatible system. Microsoft is also
maintaining a thorough (although not comprehensive) list of known SMBv1

### 18.4.5 (L1) Ensure 'Enable Certificate Padding' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

[This policy setting configures whether the WinVerifyTrust](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wintrust/nf-wintrust-winverifytrust) function performs strict
Windows Authenticode signature verification for Portable Executable files (PE files). If
enabled, PE files will be considered "unsigned" if Windows identifies content in them
that does not conform to the Authenticode specification.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

[A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the WinVerifyTrust function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wintrust/nf-wintrust-winverifytrust)
handles Windows Authenticode signature verification for portable executable (PE) files.

### 18.4.6 (L1) Ensure 'Enable Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP)' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Windows includes support for Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection
(SEHOP). We recommend enabling this feature to improve the security profile of the
computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

This feature is designed to block exploits that use the Structured Exception Handler
(SEH) overwrite technique. This protection mechanism is provided at run-time.
Therefore, it helps protect applications regardless of whether they have been compiled
with the latest improvements, such as the /SAFESEH option.

**Impact:**

After you enable SEHOP, existing versions of Cygwin, Skype, and Armadillo-protected
applications may not work correctly.

**Audit:**

### 18.4.7 (L1) Ensure 'NetBT NodeType configuration' is set to 'Enabled: P-node (recommended)' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting determines which method NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) uses to register
and resolve names. The available methods are:

  - The B-node (broadcast) method only uses broadcasts.

  - The P-node (point-to-point) method only uses name queries to a name server
(WINS).

  - The M-node (mixed) method broadcasts first, then queries a name server (WINS)
if broadcast failed.

  - The H-node (hybrid) method queries a name server (WINS) first, then broadcasts
if the query failed.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: P-node (recommended) (point-topoint).

**Note: Resolution through LMHOSTS or DNS follows these methods. If the NodeType**
registry value is present, it overrides any DhcpNodeType registry value. If neither
```
NodeType nor DhcpNodeType is present, the computer uses B-node (broadcast) if there

```
are no WINS servers configured for the network, or H-node (hybrid) if there is at least
one WINS server configured.

**Rationale:**

In order to help mitigate the risk of NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning attacks,
setting the node type to P-node (point-to-point) will prevent the system from sending out
NetBIOS broadcasts.

**Impact:**

NetBIOS name resolution queries will require a defined and available WINS server for
external NetBIOS name resolution. If a WINS server is not defined or not reachable,
and the desired hostname is not defined in the local cache, local LMHOSTS or HOSTS
files, NetBIOS name resolution will fail.

### 18.4.8 (L1) Ensure 'WDigest Authentication' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

When WDigest authentication is enabled, Lsass.exe retains a copy of the user's
plaintext password in memory, where it can be at risk of theft. If this setting is not
configured, WDigest authentication is disabled in Windows 8.1 and in Windows Server
2012 R2; it is enabled by default in earlier versions of Windows and Windows Server.

[For more information about local accounts and credential theft, review the "Mitigating](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36036)
[Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks and Other Credential Theft Techniques" documents.](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36036)

[management May 13, 2014.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2871997)

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Preventing the plaintext storage of credentials in memory may reduce opportunity for
credential theft.

**Impact:**

None - this is also the default configuration for Windows 8.1 or newer.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

### 18.5.1 (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (AutoAdminLogon) Enable Automatic Logon' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting is separate from the Welcome screen feature in Windows XP and Windows
Vista; if that feature is disabled, this setting is not disabled. If you configure a computer
for automatic logon, anyone who can physically gain access to the computer can also
gain access to everything that is on the computer, including any network or networks to
which the computer is connected. Also, if you enable automatic logon, the password is
stored in the registry in plaintext, and the specific registry key that stores this value is
remotely readable by the Authenticated Users group.

[For additional information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 324737: How to turn](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/324737)
[on automatic logon in Windows.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/324737)

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

If you configure a computer for automatic logon, anyone who can physically gain access
to the computer can also gain access to everything that is on the computer, including
any network or networks that the computer is connected to. Also, if you enable
automatic logon, the password is stored in the registry in plaintext. The specific registry
key that stores this setting is remotely readable by the Authenticated Users group. As a
result, this entry is appropriate only if the computer is physically secured and if you
ensure that untrusted users cannot remotely see the registry.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 18.5.4 (L2) Ensure 'MSS: (DisableSavePassword) Prevent the dial-up password from being saved' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

When you dial a phonebook or VPN entry in Dial-Up Networking, you can use the "Save
Password" option so that your Dial-Up Networking password is cached and you will not
need to enter it on successive dial attempts. For security, administrators may want to
prevent users from caching passwords.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

An attacker who steals a mobile user's computer could automatically connect to the
organization's network if the Save This Password check box is selected for the dial-up
or VPN networking entry used to connect to your organization's network.

**Impact:**

Users will not be able to automatically store their logon credentials for dial-up and VPN
connections.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 18.5.5 (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (EnableICMPRedirect) Allow ICMP redirects to override OSPF generated routes' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirects cause the IPv4 stack to plumb host
routes. These routes override the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) generated routes.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

This behavior is expected. The problem is that the 10 minute time-out period for the
ICMP redirect-plumbed routes temporarily creates a network situation in which traffic
will no longer be routed properly for the affected host. Ignoring such ICMP redirects will
limit the system's exposure to attacks that will impact its ability to participate on the
network.

**Impact:**

When Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) is configured as an autonomous
system boundary router (ASBR), it does not correctly import connected interface subnet
routes. Instead, this router injects host routes into the OSPF routes. However, the
OSPF router cannot be used as an ASBR router, and when connected interface subnet
routes are imported into OSPF the result is confusing routing tables with strange routing
paths.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

### 18.5.6 (L2) Ensure 'MSS: (KeepAliveTime) How often keep-alive packets are sent in milliseconds' is set to 'Enabled: 300,000 or 5 minutes' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This value controls how often TCP attempts to verify that an idle connection is still intact
by sending a keep-alive packet. If the remote computer is still reachable, it
acknowledges the keep-alive packet.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 300,000 or 5 minutes.

**Rationale:**

An attacker who is able to connect to network applications could establish numerous
connections to cause a DoS condition.

**Impact:**

Keep-alive packets are not sent by default by Windows. However, some applications
may configure the TCP stack flag that requests keep-alive packets. For such
configurations, you can lower this value from the default setting of two hours to five
minutes to disconnect inactive sessions more quickly.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 18.5.7 (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (NoNameReleaseOnDemand) Allow the computer to ignore NetBIOS name release requests except from WINS servers' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

NetBIOS over TCP/IP is a network protocol that among other things provides a way to
easily resolve NetBIOS names that are registered on Windows-based systems to the IP
addresses that are configured on those systems. This setting determines whether the
computer releases its NetBIOS name when it receives a name-release request.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

The NetBT protocol is designed not to use authentication, and is therefore vulnerable to
spoofing. Spoofing makes a transmission appear to come from a user other than the
user who performed the action. A malicious user could exploit the unauthenticated
nature of the protocol to send a name-conflict datagram to a target computer, which
would cause the computer to relinquish its name and not respond to queries.

An attacker could send a request over the network and query a computer to release its
NetBIOS name. As with any change that could affect applications, it is recommended
that you test this change in a non-production environment before you change the
production environment.

The result of such an attack could be to cause intermittent connectivity issues on the
target computer, or even to prevent the use of Network Neighborhood, domain logons,
the NET SEND command, or additional NetBIOS name resolution.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

which allows the system to detect and configure default gateway addresses
automatically as described in RFC 1256 on a per-interface basis.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

An attacker who has gained control of a computer on the same network segment could
configure a computer on the network to impersonate a router. Other computers with
IRDP enabled would then attempt to route their traffic through the already compromised
computer.

**Impact:**

Windows will not automatically detect and configure default gateway addresses on the
computer.

### 18.5.9 (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (SafeDllSearchMode) Enable Safe DLL search mode' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

The DLL search order can be configured to search for DLLs that are requested by
running processes in one of two ways:

  - Search folders specified in the system path first, and then search the current
working folder.

  - Search current working folder first, and then search the folders specified in the
system path.

When enabled, the registry value is set to 1. With a setting of 1, the system first
searches the folders that are specified in the system path and then searches the current
working folder. When disabled the registry value is set to 0 and the system first
searches the current working folder and then searches the folders that are specified in
the system path.

Applications will be forced to search for DLLs in the system path first. For applications
that require unique versions of these DLLs that are included with the application, this
entry could cause performance or stability problems.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: More information on how Safe DLL search mode works is available at this link:**
[Dynamic-Link Library Search Order - Windows applications | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order)

**Rationale:**

If a user unknowingly executes hostile code that was packaged with additional files that
include modified versions of system DLLs, the hostile code could load its own versions
of those DLLs and potentially increase the type and degree of damage the code can
render.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 18.5.10 (L1) Ensure 'MSS: (ScreenSaverGracePeriod) The time in seconds before the screen saver grace period expires' is set to 'Enabled: 5 or fewer seconds' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Windows includes a grace period between when the screen saver is launched and
when the console is actually locked automatically when screen saver locking is enabled.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 5 or fewer seconds.

**Rationale:**

The default grace period that is allowed for user movement before the screen saver lock
takes effect is five seconds. If you leave the default grace period configuration, your
computer is vulnerable to a potential attack from someone who could approach the
console and attempt to log on to the computer before the lock takes effect. An entry to
the registry can be made to adjust the length of the grace period.

**Impact:**

Users will have to enter their passwords to resume their console sessions as soon as
the grace period ends after screen saver activation.

### 18.5.11 (L2) Ensure 'MSS: (TcpMaxDataRetransmissions IPv6) How many times unacknowledged data is retransmitted' is set to 'Enabled: 3' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This setting controls the number of times that TCP retransmits an individual data
segment (non-connect segment) before the connection is aborted. The retransmission
time-out is doubled with each successive retransmission on a connection. It is reset
when responses resume. The base time-out value is dynamically determined by the
measured round-trip time on the connection.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 3.

**Rationale:**

A malicious user could exhaust a target computer's resources if it never sent any
acknowledgment messages for data that was transmitted by the target computer.

**Impact:**

TCP starts a retransmission timer when each outbound segment is passed to the IP. If
no acknowledgment is received for the data in a given segment before the timer
expires, then the segment is retransmitted up to three times.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

**Description:**

This setting can generate a security audit in the Security event log when the log reaches
a user-defined threshold.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 90% or less.

**Note: If log settings are configured to Overwrite events as needed or Overwrite events**
older than x days, this event will not be generated.

**Rationale:**

If the Security log reaches 90 percent of its capacity and the computer has not been
configured to overwrite events as needed, more recent events will not be written to the
log. If the log reaches its capacity and the computer has been configured to shut down
when it can no longer record events to the Security log, the computer will shut down and
will no longer be available to provide network services.

**Impact:**

An audit event will be generated when the Security log reaches the 90% percent full
threshold (or whatever lower value may be set) unless the log is configured to overwrite
events as needed.

### 18.6.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'Configure DNS over HTTPS (DoH) name resolution' is set to 'Enabled: Allow DoH' or higher (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting determines if DNS over HTTPS (DoH) is used by the system. DNS over
HTTPS (DoH) is a protocol for performing remote Domain Name System (DNS)
resolution over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). For additional
information on DNS over HTTPS (DoH), visit: [Secure DNS Client over HTTPS (DoH) on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/dns/doh-client-support)
[Windows Server 2022 | Microsoft Docs.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/dns/doh-client-support)

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Allow DoH. Configuring this setting
to Enabled: Require DoH also conforms to the benchmark.

**Rationale:**

DNS over HTTPS (DoH) helps protect against DNS spoofing. Spoofing makes a
transmission appear to come from a user other than the user who performed the action.
It can also help prevent man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks because the session inbetween is encrypted.

**Impact:**

If the option Enabled: Require DoH is chosen, this could limit third-party products from
logging DNS traffic (in transit) as the traffic would be encrypted while in transit. The
Require DoH option could also lead to domain-joined systems not functioning properly
within the environment.

The option Enabled: Allow DoH will perform DoH queries if the configured DNS servers
support it. If they don´t support it, classic name resolution will be used. This is the safest
option.

**Note: Per Microsoft, don't enable the Enabled: Require DoH option for domain-joined**
computers as Active Directory Domain Services is heavily reliant on DNS because the
Windows Server DNS Server service does not support DoH queries.

### 18.6.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Configure NetBIOS settings' is set to 'Enabled: Disable NetBIOS name resolution on public networks' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies if the Domain Name System (DNS) client will perform name
resolution over Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS). NetBIOS is a legacy
name resolution method for internal Microsoft networking that predates the use of DNS
for that purpose (pre–Active Directory). Some legacy applications still require the use of
NetBIOS for full functionality.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Disable NetBIOS name resolution
```
on public networks. Configuring this setting to Enabled: Disable NetBIOS name
resolution also conforms to the benchmark.

```
**Rationale:**

NetBIOS does not perform authentication and can allow remote attackers to cause a
denial of service by sending spoofed Name Conflicts or Name Release datagrams. This
is also known as "NetBIOS Name Server Protocol Spoofing". Preventing the use of
NetBIOS on public networks reduces the attack surface.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 18.6.4.3 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off multicast name resolution' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

LLMNR is a secondary name resolution protocol. With LLMNR, queries are sent using
multicast over a local network link on a single subnet from a client computer to another
client computer on the same subnet that also has LLMNR enabled. LLMNR does not
require a DNS server or DNS client configuration, and provides name resolution in
scenarios in which conventional DNS name resolution is not possible.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

An attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR (UDP/5355) or NBT-NS
(UDP/137) broadcasts and respond to them, tricking the host into thinking that it knows
the location of the requested system.

**Note: To completely mitigate local name resolution poisoning, in addition to this setting,**
the properties of each installed NIC should also be set to Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP
(on the WINS tab in the NIC properties). Unfortunately, there is no global setting to
achieve this that automatically applies to all NICs - it is a per-NIC setting that varies with
different NIC hardware installations.

**Impact:**

In the event DNS is unavailable a system will be unable to request it from other systems
on the same subnet.

This policy setting changes the operational behavior of the Responder network protocol
driver.

The Responder allows a computer to participate in Link Layer Topology Discovery
requests so that it can be discovered and located on the network. It also allows a
computer to participate in Quality-of-Service activities such as bandwidth estimation and

### 18.6.11.2 (L1) Ensure 'Prohibit installation and configuration of Network Bridge on your DNS domain network' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

You can use this procedure to control a user's ability to install and configure a Network
Bridge.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

The Network Bridge setting, if enabled, allows users to create a Layer 2 Media Access
Control (MAC) bridge, enabling them to connect two or more physical network
segments together. A Network Bridge thus allows a computer that has connections to
two different networks to share data between those networks.

In an enterprise managed environment, where there is a need to control network traffic
to only authorized paths, allowing users to create a Network Bridge increases the risk
and attack surface from the bridged network.

**Impact:**

Users cannot create or configure a Network Bridge.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether to require domain users to elevate when setting
a network's location.

### 18.6.14.1 (L1) Ensure 'Hardened UNC Paths' is set to 'Enabled, with "Require Mutual Authentication", "Require Integrity", and “Require Privacy” set for all NETLOGON and SYSVOL shares' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting configures secure access to UNC paths.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled, with "Require Mutual
```
Authentication", "Require Integrity", and “Require Privacy” set for all
NETLOGON and SYSVOL shares.

```
**Rationale:**

In February 2015, Microsoft released a new control mechanism to mitigate a security
[risk in Group Policy as part of the MS15-011](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS15-011) / [MSKB 3000483](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3000483) security update. This
mechanism requires both the installation of the new security update and also the
deployment of specific group policy settings to all computers on the domain from
Windows Vista / Server 2008 (non-R2) or newer (the associated security patch to
enable this feature was not released for Server 2003). A new group policy template
(NetworkProvider.admx/adml) was also provided with the security update.

Once the new GPO template is in place, the following are the minimum requirements to
remediate the Group Policy security risk:
```
\\*\NETLOGON RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1,
RequirePrivacy=1
\\*\SYSVOL RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1,
RequirePrivacy=1

```
**Note: A reboot may be required after the setting is applied to a client machine to access**

### 18.6.19.2.1 (L2) Disable IPv6 (Ensure TCPIP6 Parameter 'DisabledComponents' is set to '0xff (255)') (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange
information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for
many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and
operating systems may not support IPv6 natively.

The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)

**Rationale:**

Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize
IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6
components removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic
on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not
needed.

**Impact:**

Connectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that
depends on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of Microsoft applications that may use
IPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail.

[This registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: How](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929852)
[to disable IPv6 or its components in Windows.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929852)

**Note: This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot.**

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 255.

```
```
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP6\Parameters:DisabledComponents

```

Page 587


-----

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff
```
(255) (DWORD):
HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP6\Parameters:DisabledComponents

```
**Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.**

**Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this**
registry value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is
provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware
though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not
"undo" the change once applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to
change the registry value to the opposite state.

**Default Value:**

All IPv6 components are enabled and Windows prefers IPv6 over IPv4.

### 18.6.21.1 (L1) Ensure 'Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows Domain' is set to 'Enabled: 3 = Prevent Wi-Fi when on Ethernet' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting prevents computers from establishing multiple simultaneous
connections to either the Internet or to a Windows domain.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 3 = Prevent Wi-Fi when on
```
Ethernet.

```
**Rationale:**

Preventing bridged network connections can help prevent a user unknowingly allowing
traffic to route between internal and external networks, which risks exposure to sensitive
internal data.

**Impact:**

While connected to an Ethernet connection, Windows won't allow use of a WLAN
(automatically or manually) until Ethernet is disconnected. However, if a cellular data
connection is available, it will always stay connected for services that require it, but no
Internet traffic will be routed over cellular if an Ethernet or WLAN connection is present.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 3.

### 18.6.21.2 (L1) Ensure 'Prohibit connection to non-domain networks when connected to domain authenticated network' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting prevents computers from connecting to both a domain based network
and a non-domain based network at the same time.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

The potential concern is that a user would unknowingly allow network traffic to flow
between the insecure public network and the enterprise managed network.

**Impact:**

The computer responds to automatic and manual network connection attempts based
on the following circumstances:

_Automatic connection attempts - When the computer is already connected to a domain_
based network, all automatic connection attempts to non-domain networks are blocked.

- When the computer is already connected to a non-domain based network, automatic
connection attempts to domain based networks are blocked.

_Manual connection attempts - When the computer is already connected to either a non-_
domain based network or a domain based network over media other than Ethernet, and
a user attempts to create a manual connection to an additional network in violation of
this policy setting, the existing network connection is disconnected and the manual
connection is allowed. - When the computer is already connected to either a nondomain based network or a domain based network over Ethernet, and a user attempts
to create a manual connection to an additional network in violation of this policy setting,
the existing Ethernet connection is maintained and the manual connection attempt is
blocked.

### 18.6.23.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Windows to automatically connect to suggested open hotspots, to networks shared by contacts, and to hotspots offering paid services' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether users can enable the following WLAN settings:
"Connect to suggested open hotspots," "Connect to networks shared by my contacts,"
and "Enable paid services".

  - "Connect to suggested open hotspots" enables Windows to automatically
connect users to open hotspots it knows about by crowdsourcing networks that
other people using Windows have connected to.

  - "Connect to networks shared by my contacts" enables Windows to automatically
connect to networks that the user's contacts have shared with them, and enables
users on this device to share networks with their contacts.

  - "Enable paid services" enables Windows to temporarily connect to open hotspots
to determine if paid services are available.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: These features are also known by the name "Wi-Fi Sense".**

**Rationale:**

Automatically connecting to an open hotspot or network can introduce the system to a
rogue network with malicious intent.

**Impact:**

_Connect to suggested open hotspots, Connect to networks shared by my contacts, and_
_Enable paid services will each be turned off and users on the device will be prevented_
from enabling them.

### 18.7.11 (L1) Ensure 'Point and Print Restrictions: When updating drivers for an existing connection' is set to 'Enabled: Show warning and elevation prompt' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether computers will show a warning and a security
elevation prompt when users are updating drivers for an existing connection using Point
and Print.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Show warning and elevation
```

```
**[Note: On August 10, 2021, Microsoft announced a Point and Print Default Behavior](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/08/10/point-and-print-default-behavior-change/)**
[Change](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/08/10/point-and-print-default-behavior-change/) which modifies the default Point and Print driver installation and update
[behavior to require Administrator privileges. This is documented in KB5005652—](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/kb5005652-manage-new-point-and-print-default-driver-installation-behavior-cve-2021-34481-873642bf-2634-49c5-a23b-6d8e9a302872)

change overrides all Point and Print Group Policy settings and ensures that only
Administrators can install printer drivers from a print server using Point and Print.

**Rationale:**

Enabling Windows User Account Control (UAC) for updating existing print drivers can
[help mitigate the PrintNightmare vulnerability (CVE-2021-34527) and other Print](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527)
Spooler attacks.

Although the Point and Print default driver installation behavior overrides this setting, it
is important to configure this as a backstop in the event that behavior is reversed.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 18.8.1.1 (L2) Ensure 'Turn off notifications network usage' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting blocks applications from using the network to send notifications to
update tiles, tile badges, toast, or raw notifications. This policy setting turns off the
connection between Windows and the Windows Push Notification Service (WNS). This
policy setting also stops applications from being able to poll application services to
update tiles.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) is a mechanism to receive third-party
notifications and updates from the cloud/Internet. In a high security environment,
external systems, especially those hosted outside the organization, should be prevented
from having an impact on the secure workstations.

### 18.9.3.1 (L1) Ensure 'Include command line in process creation events' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether the process creation command line text is logged in
security audit events when a new process has been created.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This feature that this setting controls was not originally supported in workstation**
OSes older than Windows 8.1. However, in February 2015 Microsoft added support for
[the feature to Windows 7 and Windows 8.0 via an update - KB3004375. Therefore, this](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3004375/microsoft-security-advisory-update-to-improve-windows-command-line-aud)
setting is also important to set on those older OSes.

**Rationale:**

Capturing process command line information in event logs can be very valuable when
performing forensic investigations of attack incidents.

**Impact:**

Process command line information will be included in the event logs, which can contain
sensitive or private information such as passwords or user data.

**Warning: There are potential risks of capturing credentials and sensitive information**
which could be exposed to users who have read-access to event logs. Microsoft
provides a feature called "Protected Event Logging" to better secure event log data. For

### 18.9.4.1 (L1) Ensure 'Encryption Oracle Remediation' is set to 'Enabled: Force Updated Clients' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Some versions of the CredSSP protocol that is used by some applications (such as
Remote Desktop Connection) are vulnerable to an encryption oracle attack against the
client. This policy controls compatibility with vulnerable clients and servers and allows
you to set the level of protection desired for the encryption oracle vulnerability.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Force Updated Clients.

**Rationale:**

This setting is important to mitigate the CredSSP encryption oracle vulnerability, for
[which information was published by Microsoft on 03/13/2018 in CVE-2018-0886 |](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-0886)
[CredSSP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. All versions of Windows from Windows](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-0886)
Vista onwards are affected by this vulnerability, and will be compatible with this
recommendation provided that they have been patched at least through May 2018 (or
later).

**Impact:**

Client applications which use CredSSP will not be able to fall back to the insecure
versions and services using CredSSP will not accept unpatched clients. This setting
should not be deployed until all remote hosts support the newest version, which is
achieved by ensuring that all Microsoft security updates at least through May 2018 are
installed.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\CredSSP\Parame

### 18.9.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Remote host allows delegation of non- exportable credentials' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Remote host allows delegation of non-exportable credentials. When using credential
delegation, devices provide an exportable version of credentials to the remote host. This
exposes users to the risk of credential theft from attackers on the remote host. The
Restricted Admin Mode and Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard features are
two options to help protect against this risk.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: More detailed information on Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard and**
[how it compares to Restricted Admin Mode can be found at this link: Protect Remote](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/access-protection/remote-credential-guard)
[Desktop credentials with Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard (Windows 10) |](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/access-protection/remote-credential-guard)
[Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/access-protection/remote-credential-guard)

**Rationale:**

_Restricted Admin Mode was designed to help protect administrator accounts by_
ensuring that reusable credentials are not stored in memory on remote devices that
could potentially be compromised. Windows Defender Remote Credential Guard helps
you protect your credentials over a Remote Desktop connection by redirecting Kerberos
requests back to the device that is requesting the connection. Both features should be
enabled and supported, as they reduce the chance of credential theft.

**Impact:**

The host will support the Restricted Admin Mode and Windows Defender Remote
_Credential Guard features._

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

### 18.9.5.1 (L1) Ensure 'Turn On Virtualization Based Security' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether Virtualization Based Security is enabled.
Virtualization Based Security uses the Windows Hypervisor to provide support for
security services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure**
Boot enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS
configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a
virtual machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
must be exposed by the host to the guest VM.

[More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements)
[Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements)

**Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using**
Azure IaaS VMs.

**Note #3: If the Level 2 recommendation to configure Log on as a service (from Section**
2.2) is implemented, the additional security principal WDAGUtilityAccount must also be
granted that User Right Assignment in order for Virtualization Based Security (in
Microsoft Defender Application Guard) with the Next Generation Windows Security
(NGWS) profile to function.

**Rationale:**

Kerberos, NTLM, and Credential manager isolate secrets by using virtualization-based
security. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority
(LSA). Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its
process memory. With Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled, the LSA process
in the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that
stores and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected
using virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating
system.

Page 639


-----

**Impact:**

**Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1)**
profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only. NG profile settings were isolated
from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11
Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware
compatibility is no longer an issue.

**Warning: All drivers on the system must be compatible with this feature or the system**
may crash. Ensure that this policy setting is only deployed to computers which are
known to be compatible.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

### 18.9.5.2 (L1) Ensure 'Turn On Virtualization Based Security: Select Platform Security Level' is set to 'Secure Boot' or higher (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether Virtualization Based Security (VBS) is enabled.
VBS uses the Windows Hypervisor to provide support for security services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Secure Boot or Secure Boot and DMA
```
Protection.

```
**Note: VBS requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, which in**
turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI BIOS configuration, not a Legacy
BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on a virtual machine, the hardwareassisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) must be exposed by the host
to the guest VM.

[More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements)
[Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements)

**Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using**
Azure IaaS VMs.

**Rationale:**

Secure Boot can help reduce the risk of bootloader attacks and in conjunction with DMA
protections to help protect data from being scraped from memory.

Page 642


-----

**Impact:**

Choosing the Secure Boot option provides the system with as much protection as is
supported by the computer’s hardware. A system with input/output memory
management units (IOMMUs) will have Secure Boot with DMA protection. A system
without IOMMUs will simply have Secure Boot enabled without DMA protection.

Choosing the Secure Boot with DMA protection option requires the system to have
IOMMUs in order to enable VBS. Without IOMMU hardware support, VBS will be
disabled.

**Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1)**
profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only. NG profile settings were isolated
from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11
Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware
compatibility is no longer an issue.

**Warning: All drivers on the system must be compatible with this feature or the system**
may crash. Ensure that this policy setting is only deployed to computers which are

### 18.9.5.4 (L1) Ensure 'Turn On Virtualization Based Security: Require UEFI Memory Attributes Table' is set to 'True (checked)' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This option will only enable Virtualization Based Protection of Code Integrity on devices
with UEFI firmware support for the Memory Attributes Table. Devices without the UEFI
Memory Attributes Table may have firmware that is incompatible with Virtualization
Based Protection of Code Integrity which in some cases can lead to crashes or data
loss or incompatibility with certain plug-in cards. If not setting this option the targeted
devices should be tested to ensure compatibility.

The recommended state for this setting is: True (checked).

**Note: Virtualization Based Security requires a 64-bit version of Windows with Secure**

### 18.9.5.6 (L1) Ensure 'Turn On Virtualization Based Security: Secure Launch Configuration' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

Secure Launch protects the Virtualization Based Security environment from exploited
vulnerabilities in device firmware.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using**
Azure IaaS VMs.

**Rationale:**

Secure Launch changes the way Windows boots to use Intel Trusted Execution
Technology (TXT) and Runtime BIOS Resilience features to prevent firmware exploits
from being able to impact the security of the Windows Virtualization Based Security
environment.

**Impact:**

**Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1)**

### 18.9.5.7 (L1) Ensure 'Turn On Virtualization Based Security: Kernel-mode Hardware-enforced Stack Protection' is set to 'Enabled: Enabled in enforcement mode' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting enables Hardware-enforced Stack Protection for kernel-mode code.
Kernel-mode data stacks are hardened with hardware-based shadow stacks, which
store intended return address targets to ensure that program control flow is not
tampered.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Enabled in enforcement mode.

**Note: Virtualization Based Security (VBS) requires a 64-bit version of Windows with**
Secure Boot enabled, which in turn requires that Windows was installed with a UEFI
BIOS configuration, not a Legacy BIOS configuration. In addition, if running Windows on
a virtual machine, the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature (Intel VT-x or AMDV) must be exposed by the host to the guest VM.

[More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements)
[Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/credential-guard/credential-guard-requirements)

**Note #2: This specific security feature of VBS is only compatible with Windows 11**
Release 22H2 (or newer).

**Note #3: Only Intel CPUs from Tiger Lake and beyond or AMD CPUs Zen3 and beyond**
(both were release in fall 2020) are compatible with this security feature.

**Note #4: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using**
Azure IaaS VMs.

**Rationale:**

This setting stores a copy of the apps shadow stack (intended code execution flow) in
the hardware-based (CPU) security feature VBS. This can prevent malware from
hijacking an apps code by exploiting memory bugs such as stack buffer overflows,
dangling pointers, or uninitialized variables. This allows VBS to shut down any exploit
attempts via the modification of the intended code execution flow.

Page 655


-----

**Impact:**

This setting is dependent upon Virtualization Based Protection of Code Integrity (aka
HVCI) first being enabled, in addition to CPU hardware support for shadow stacks. If
either HVCI is not enabled or hardware-based shadow stacks are not supported, this
setting will have no effect.

If this setting is successfully enabled, shadow stack violations will be fatal.

**Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1)**
profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only. NG profile settings were isolated
from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11
Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware

updated as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: In versions of Windows 10 Release 1803 (or newer), there is a new control**
named Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA
_Protection available that mitigates much of the risk for malicious devices that may_
perform Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks. The newer control is also now part of the
Windows 10 CIS benchmark, in section 18.8.26. However, if your environment still
contains any Windows 10 Release 1709 (or older) workstations, then the newer control
will not work, so this setting remains important to disable Thunderbolt devices on those
systems.

**Rationale:**

A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA)
attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes
when the workstation is locked.

BitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without
any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA
attacks.

### 18.9.7.1.2 (BL) Ensure 'Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs: Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs' is set to 'PCI\CC_0C0A' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to specify a list of Plug and Play hardware IDs and
compatible IDs for devices that Windows is prevented from installing. This policy setting
takes precedence over any other policy setting that allows Windows to install a device.

If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing a device whose
hardware ID or compatible ID appears in the list you create. If you enable this policy
setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified
devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, devices can be installed and
updated as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.

The recommended state for this setting is: PCI\CC_0C0A

**Note: This device ID is for Thunderbolt controllers. The USB Type-C (USB-C) port**
standard that is now common in many computers, especially laptops, utilizes
Thunderbolt technology, and therefore may be affected by this restriction. If your
organization needs to use USB-C extensively, you may need to decide, internally, to
allow yourselves an exception to this recommendation. However, please ensure that all
necessary decision-makers have accepted the increased risk of BitLocker encryption
key theft (and therefore data theft) via malicious Thunderbolt devices (when left
unattended), by doing so.

**Note #2: In versions of Windows 10 Release 1803 (or newer), there is a new control**
named Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA
_Protection available that mitigates much of the risk for malicious devices that may_
perform Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks. The newer control is also now part of the
Windows 10 CIS benchmark, in section 18.8.26. However, if your environment still
contains any Windows 10 Release 1709 (or older) workstations, then the newer control

### 18.9.7.2 (L1) Ensure 'Prevent device metadata retrieval from the Internet' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to prevent Windows from retrieving device metadata from
the Internet.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This will not prevent the installation of basic hardware drivers, but does prevent**
associated third-party utility software from automatically being installed under the
context of the SYSTEM account.

**Rationale:**

Installation of software should be conducted by an authorized system administrator and
not a standard user. Allowing automatic third-party software installations under the
context of the SYSTEM account has potential for allowing unauthorized access via
backdoors or installation software bugs.

**Impact:**

Standard users without administrator privileges will not be able to install associated
third-party utility software for peripheral devices. This may limit the use of advanced
features of those devices unless/until an administrator installs the associated utility
software for the device.

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to specify which boot-start drivers are initialized based on
a classification determined by an Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver. The Early
Launch Antimalware boot-start driver can return the following classifications for each
boot-start driver:

  - `Good: The driver has been signed and has not been tampered with.`

  - `Bad: The driver has been identified as malware. It is recommended that you do`
not allow known bad drivers to be initialized.

  - `Bad, but required for boot: The driver has been identified as malware, but the`
computer cannot successfully boot without loading this driver.

  - `Unknown: This driver has not been attested to by your malware detection`
application and has not been classified by the Early Launch Antimalware bootstart driver.

If you enable this policy setting you will be able to choose which boot-start drivers to
initialize the next time the computer is started.

If your malware detection application does not include an Early Launch Antimalware
boot-start driver or if your Early Launch Antimalware boot-start driver has been
disabled, this setting has no effect and all boot-start drivers are initialized.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Good, unknown and bad but
```
critical.

```
**Rationale:**

This policy setting helps reduce the impact of malware that has already infected your
system.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 18.9.19.2 (L1) Ensure 'Configure registry policy processing: Do not apply during periodic background processing' is set to 'Enabled: FALSE' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

The "Do not apply during periodic background processing" option prevents the system
from updating affected registry policies in the background while the computer is in use.
When background updates are disabled, registry policy changes will not take effect until
the next user logon or system restart.

This setting affects all policy settings within the Administrative Templates folder and any
other policies that store values in the registry.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: FALSE (unchecked).

**Rationale:**

Setting this option to false (unchecked) will ensure that domain registry policy changes
are applied more quickly, as compared to waiting until the next user logon or system
restart.

**Impact:**

Group Policy settings within the Administrative Templates folder (and other policies that
store values in the registry) will be reapplied even when the system is in use, which may
have a slight impact on performance.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

The "Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed" option updates and
reapplies registry policies even if the registry policies have not changed.

This setting affects all registry policy settings within the Administrative Templates folder
and any other policies that store values in the registry.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: TRUE (checked).

**Rationale:**

Setting this option to true (checked) will ensure unauthorized local changes are reverted
to match the domain-based Group Policy settings.

**Impact:**

Group Policy settings within the Administrative Templates folder (and other policies that
store values in the registry) will be reapplied even if they have not been changed, which
may cause Group Policy refreshes to take longer.

**Description:**

The "Do not apply during periodic background processing" option prevents the system
from updating affected security policies in the background while the computer is in use.
When background updates are disabled, updates to security policies will not take effect
until the next user logon or system restart.

This setting affects all policy settings that use the built-in security template of Group
Policy (e.g. Windows Settings\Security Settings).

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: FALSE (unchecked).

**Rationale:**

Setting this option to false (unchecked) will ensure that domain security policy changes
are applied more quickly, as compared to waiting until the next user logon or system
restart.

**Impact:**

Built-in security template settings will be reapplied by Group Policy even when the
system is in use, which may have a slight impact on performance.

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether the Windows device is allowed to participate in
cross-device experiences (continue experiences).

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

A cross-device experience is when a system can access app and send messages to
other devices. In an enterprise managed environment only trusted systems should be

### 18.9.20.1.1 (L2) Ensure 'Turn off access to the Store' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether to use the Store service for finding an application to
open a file with an unhandled file type or protocol association. When a user opens a file
type or protocol that is not associated with any applications on the computer, the user is
given the choice to select a local application or use the Store service to find an
application.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

The Store service is a retail outlet built into Windows, primarily for consumer use. In an
enterprise managed environment the IT department should be managing the installation
of all applications to reduce the risk of the installation of vulnerable software.

**Impact:**

The "Look for an app in the Store" item in the Open With dialog is removed.

### 18.9.20.1.3 (L2) Ensure 'Turn off handwriting personalization data sharing' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This setting turns off data sharing from the handwriting recognition personalization tool.

The handwriting recognition personalization tool enables Tablet PC users to adapt
handwriting recognition to their own writing style by providing writing samples. The tool
can optionally share user writing samples with Microsoft to improve handwriting
recognition in future versions of Windows. The tool generates reports and transmits
them to Microsoft over a secure connection.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

A person's handwriting is Personally Identifiable Information (PII), especially when it
comes to your signature. As such, it is unacceptable in many environments to
automatically upload PII to a website without explicit approval by the user.

**Impact:**

Tablet PC users cannot choose to share writing samples from the handwriting
recognition personalization tool with Microsoft.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\TabletPC:PreventHandwritingDataShari

```
**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether the Internet Connection Wizard can connect to
Microsoft to download a list of Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

In an enterprise managed environment we want to lower the risk of a user unknowingly
exposing sensitive data.

**Impact:**

The "Choose a list of Internet Service Providers" path in the Internet Connection Wizard
causes the wizard to exit. This prevents users from retrieving the list of ISPs, which

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether Windows will download a list of providers for the

### 18.9.20.1.7 (L2) Ensure 'Turn off printing over HTTP' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to disable the client computer's ability to print over HTTP,
which allows the computer to print to printers on the intranet as well as the Internet.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This control affects printing over both HTTP and HTTPS.**

**Rationale:**

Information that is transmitted over HTTP through this capability is not protected and
can be intercepted by malicious users. For this reason, it is not often used in enterprise
managed environments.

**Impact:**

The client computer will not be able to print to Internet printers over HTTP or HTTPS.

**Note: This policy setting affects the client side of Internet printing only. Regardless of**
how it is configured, a computer could act as an Internet Printing server and make its
shared printers available through HTTP.

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether Search Companion should automatically download
content updates during local and Internet searches.

**Rationale:**

There is a small risk that users will unknowingly reveal sensitive information because of
the topics they are searching for. This risk is very low because even if this setting is
enabled users still must submit search queries to the desired search engine in order to
perform searches.

**Impact:**

Search Companion does not download content updates during searches.

**Note: Internet searches will still send the search text and information about the search**

information about how the Windows Messenger software and service is used.

Microsoft uses information collected through the Windows Customer Experience
Improvement Program to detect software flaws so that they can be corrected more
quickly, enabling this setting will reduce the amount of data Microsoft is able to gather
for this purpose. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Large enterprise managed environments may not want to have information collected by
Microsoft from managed client computers.

**Impact:**

All users are opted out of the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

```
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\SQMClient\Windows:CEIPEnable

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```
Enabled:

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether or not errors are reported to Microsoft.

Error Reporting is used to report information about a system or application that has
failed or has stopped responding and is used to improve the quality of the product.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

If a Windows Error occurs in a secure, enterprise managed environment, the error
should be reported directly to IT staff for troubleshooting and remediation. There is no
benefit to the corporation to report these errors directly to Microsoft, and there is some
risk of unknowingly exposing sensitive data as part of the error.

### 18.9.23.1 (L2) Ensure 'Support device authentication using certificate' is set to 'Enabled: Automatic' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to set support for Kerberos to attempt authentication using
the certificate for the device to the domain.

Support for device authentication using certificate will require connectivity to a DC in the
device account domain which supports certificate authentication for computer accounts.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Automatic.

**Rationale:**

Having stronger device authentication with the use of certificates is strongly encouraged
over standard username and password authentication. Having this set to Automatic will
allow certificate based authentication to be used whenever possible.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

### 18.9.24.1 (BL) Ensure 'Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection' is set to 'Enabled: Block All' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy is intended to provide additional security against external DMA-capable
devices. It allows for more control over the enumeration of external DMA-capable
devices that are not compatible with DMA Remapping/device memory isolation and
sandboxing.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Block All.

**Note: This policy does not apply to 1394, PCMCIA or ExpressCard devices. The**
protection also only applies to Windows 10 R1803 or higher and requires a UEFI BIOS
to function.

**[Note #2: More information on this feature is available at this link: Kernel DMA Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt)**
[for Thunderbolt™ 3 (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/kernel-dma-protection-for-thunderbolt)

**Rationale:**

Device memory sandboxing allows the OS to leverage the I/O Memory Management
Unit (IOMMU) of a device to block unpermitted I/O, or memory access, by the
peripheral.

**Impact:**

External devices that are not compatible with DMA-remapping will not be enumerated
and will not function unless/until the user has logged in successfully and has an
unlocked user session. Once enumerated, these devices will continue to function,
regardless of the state of the session. Devices that are compatible with DMA-remapping
will be enumerated immediately, with their device memory isolated.

### 18.9.25.1 (L1) Ensure 'Configure password backup directory' is set to 'Enabled: Active Directory' or 'Enabled: Azure Active Directory' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting configures which directory Windows LAPS will use to back up the
local admin account password.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Active Directory or Enabled:
```
Azure Active Directory.

```
**Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &**
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these
LAPS recommendations.

**Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined**
to an Active Directory domain or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

**Note #3: Windows LAPS does not support simultaneous storage of the local admin**
password in both directory types.

**Note #4: If the setting is configured and the managed device is not joined to the**
configured directory type, the local administrator password will not be managed by
Windows LAPS.

**Rationale:**

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations
choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when
deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an
attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local
Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to
all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

**Impact:**

The passwords managed by Windows LAPS will only be retrievable from the configured
directory type.

**Description:**

This policy setting configures whether the password age dictated by the Windows LAPS
"Password Settings" policy is enforced and cannot be extended manually (only
shortened) by an authorized technician.

If an expiration is detected, the password is changed immediately, and password
expiration is set according to policy.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &**
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these
LAPS recommendations.

**Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined**

### 18.9.25.3 (L1) Ensure 'Enable password encryption' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether the Windows LAPS managed password is
encrypted before being sent to Active Directory.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &**
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these
LAPS recommendations.

**Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined**
to an Active Directory domain or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

**Note #3: This setting has no effect unless the password has been configured to be**
backed up to Active Directory, and the Active Directory domain functional level is at
Windows Server 2016 or above.

**Note #4: This setting has no relevance (but is harmless) when storing Windows LAPS**
passwords to Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) as it automatically encrypts all
Windows LAPS passwords.

**Rationale:**

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations
choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when
deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an
attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local
Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to
all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

If the domain functional level is set at or above Windows Server 2016, the Windows
LAPS managed account password is encrypted automatically, if it is set at a lower
domain functional level, the Windows LAPS managed account password will not be
backed up to the directory.

### 18.9.25.4 (L1) Ensure 'Password Settings: Password Complexity' is set to 'Enabled: Large letters + small letters + numbers + special characters' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting configures the Windows LAPS Password Settings policy for
password complexity.

Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For
instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 26 to the
power of 7 (approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion) possible combinations.
At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it
would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case
sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive
alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character
password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations.
Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it
would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will
significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard
characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it
difficult to mount a brute force attack.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Large letters + small letters +
```
numbers + special characters.

```
**Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &**
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these
LAPS recommendations.

**Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined**

### 18.9.25.6 (L1) Ensure 'Password Settings: Password Age (Days)' is set to 'Enabled: 30 or fewer' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting configures the Windows LAPS Password Settings policy for
password length.

Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For
instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 26 to the
power of 7 (approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion) possible combinations.
At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it
would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case
sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive
alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character
password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations.
Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it
would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will
significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard
characters such as "!" or "@". Proper use of the password settings can help make it
difficult to mount a brute force attack.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 30 or fewer.

**Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &**
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these
LAPS recommendations.

**Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined**
to an Active Directory domain or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

**Rationale:**

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations
choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when
deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an
attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local
Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to
all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior, unless set to fewer than 30 days.

### 18.9.25.7 (L1) Ensure 'Post-authentication actions: Grace period (hours)' is set to 'Enabled: 8 or fewer hours, but not 0' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy settings configures post-authentication actions which will be executed after
detecting an authentication by the Windows LAPS managed account. The Grace period
refers to the amount of time (hours) to wait after an authentication before executing the
specified post-authentication actions.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 8 or fewer hours, but not 0.

**Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &**
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these
LAPS recommendations.

**Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined**
to an Active Directory domain or Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).

**Note #3: If this policy is set to 0 it prevents all post-authentication actions from**
occurring.

**Rationale:**

Due to the difficulty in managing local Administrator passwords, many organizations
choose to use the same password on all workstations and/or Member Servers when
deploying them. This creates a serious attack surface security risk because if an
attacker manages to compromise one system and learn the password to its local
Administrator account, then they can leverage that account to instantly gain access to
all other computers that also use that password for their local Administrator account.

**Impact:**

After 8 hours, the Windows LAPS managed account password will be reset and log off
the system.

### 18.9.25.8 (L1) Ensure 'Post-authentication actions: Actions' is set to 'Enabled: Reset the password and logoff the managed account' or higher (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy settings configures post-authentication actions which will be executed after
detecting an authentication by the LAPS managed account. The Action refers to actions
to take upon expiry of the grace period before executing the specified postauthentication actions.

Post-authentication actions:

  - `Reset password: upon expiry of the grace period, the managed account`
password will be reset.

  - `Reset the password and logoff the managed account: upon expiry of the grace`
period, the managed account password will be reset and any interactive logon
sessions using the managed account will terminated.

  - `Reset the password and reboot the device: upon expiry of the grace period,`
the managed account password will be reset and the managed device will be
immediately rebooted.

**Warning: After an interactive logon session is terminated, other authenticated sessions**
using the Windows LAPS managed account may still be active. The only way to ensure
that the previous password is no longer in use is to reboot the OS.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Reset the password and logoff
```
the managed account or higher.

```
**Note: Organizations that utilize third-party commercial software to manage unique &**
complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these
LAPS recommendations.

**Note #2: Windows LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined**

### 18.9.26.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Custom SSPs and APs to be loaded into LSASS' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls the configuration under which the Local Security Authority
Subsystem Service (LSASS) will load custom Security Support Provider/Authentication
Package (SSP/AP).

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Vulnerabilities exist where attackers are able to intercept logon credentials via SSP/AP.
Disabling Custom SSPs and APs to be loaded into LSASS minimizes this vulnerability.

**Impact:**

Custom Security Support Provider/Authentication Packages will not be permitted to load
this may impact some legitimate third-party packages.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

### 18.9.26.2 (L1) Ensure 'Configures LSASS to run as a protected process' is set to 'Enabled: Enabled with UEFI Lock' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether the Local Security Authority Subservice Service
(LSASS) runs in protected mode and also has the option to lock in protected mode with
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). The Local Security Authority (LSA), which
includes the LSASS process, validates users for local and remote sign-ins and enforces
local security policies.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Enabled with UEFI Lock.

**Note: This additional protection to prevent reading memory and code injection by non-**
protected processes is supported by Windows 8.1 (or newer).

**Rationale:**

Provides added security for the credentials that LSA stores and manages. Enabling this
setting with UEFI Lock prevents the setting from being changed remotely.

**Impact:**

Once this setting has been applied (Enabled), removing the group policy setting (set to
Not Configured) will not reverse the impact. In order to reverse the impact, you must
[explicitly configure this setting to Disabled and follow Microsoft's documentation on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn408187(v=ws.11)#to-disable-lsa-protection)

### 18.9.28.1 (L1) Ensure 'Block user from showing account details on sign-in' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy prevents the user from showing account details (email address or user
name) on the sign-in screen.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or
someone who is able to connect to the workstation through Remote Desktop Services)
could view the name of the last user who logged on to the server. The attacker could
then try to guess the password, use a dictionary, or use a brute-force attack to try and
log on.

### 18.9.28.3 (L1) Ensure 'Do not enumerate connected users on domain-joined computers' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting prevents connected users from being enumerated on domain-joined
computers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

A malicious user could use this feature to gather account names of other users, that
information could then be used in conjunction with other types of attacks such as
guessing passwords or social engineering. The value of this countermeasure is small
because a user with domain credentials could gather the same account information
using other methods.

**Impact:**

The Logon UI will not enumerate any connected users on domain-joined computers.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

### 18.9.28.4 (L1) Ensure 'Enumerate local users on domain-joined computers' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows local users to be enumerated on domain-joined computers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

A malicious user could use this feature to gather account names of other users, that
information could then be used in conjunction with other types of attacks such as
guessing passwords or social engineering. The value of this countermeasure is small
because a user with domain credentials could gather the same account information
using other methods.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

```
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System:EnumerateLocalUsers

**Remediation:**

### 18.9.28.6 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off picture password sign-in' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to control whether a domain user can sign in using a
picture password.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: If the picture password feature is permitted, the user's domain password is**
cached in the system vault when using it.

**Rationale:**

Picture passwords bypass the requirement for a typed complex password. In a shared
work environment, a simple shoulder surf where someone observed the on-screen
gestures would allow that person to gain access to the system without the need to know
the complex password. Vertical monitor screens with an image are much more visible at
a distance than horizontal key strokes, increasing the likelihood of a successful
observation of the mouse gestures.

**Impact:**

Users will not be able to set up or sign in with a picture password.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

### 18.9.28.7 (L1) Ensure 'Turn on convenience PIN sign-in' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to control whether a domain user can sign in using a
convenience PIN. In Windows 10, convenience PIN was replaced with Passport, which
has stronger security properties. To configure Passport for domain users, use the
policies under Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows
Components\Microsoft Passport for Work.

**Note: The user's domain password will be cached in the system vault when using this**
feature.

**Note #2: If this setting is Disabled, Windows Hello will not allow Windows Hello Face or**
Fingerprint to be configured. An exception to this recommendation might be needed if
these features are used in the environment.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

A PIN is created from a much smaller selection of characters than a password, so in
most cases a PIN will be much less robust than a password.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

**Description:**

This setting determines whether Clipboard contents can be synchronized across
devices.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

In high security environments, clipboard data should stay local to the system and not
synced across devices, as it may contain very sensitive information that must be
contained locally.

### 18.9.33.6.3 (BL) Ensure 'Allow standby states (S1-S3) when sleeping (on battery)' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting manages whether or not Windows is allowed to use standby states
when putting the computer in a sleep state.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

System sleep states (S1-S3) keep power to the RAM which may contain secrets, such
as the BitLocker volume encryption key. An attacker finding a computer in sleep states
(S1-S3) could directly attack the memory of the computer and gain access to the
secrets through techniques such as RAM reminisce and direct memory access (DMA).

### 18.9.35.2 (L1) Ensure 'Configure Solicited Remote Assistance' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to turn on or turn off Solicited (Ask for) Remote Assistance
on this computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

There is slight risk that a rogue administrator will gain access to another user's desktop
session, however, they cannot connect to a user's computer unannounced or control it
without permission from the user. When an expert tries to connect, the user can still
choose to deny the connection or give the expert view-only privileges. The user must
explicitly click the Yes button to allow the expert to remotely control the workstation.

**Impact:**

Users on this computer cannot use e-mail or file transfer to ask someone for help. Also,
users cannot use instant messaging programs to allow connections to this computer.

### 18.9.36.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enable RPC Endpoint Mapper Client Authentication' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether RPC clients authenticate with the Endpoint Mapper
Service when the call they are making contains authentication information. The
Endpoint Mapper Service on computers running Windows NT4 (all service packs)
cannot process authentication information supplied in this manner. This policy setting
can cause a specific issue with 1-way forest trusts if it is applied to the trusting domain
[DCs (see Microsoft KB3073942), so we do not recommend applying it to Domain](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073942)
Controllers.

**Note: This policy will not in effect until the system is rebooted.**

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Anonymous access to RPC services could result in accidental disclosure of information
to unauthenticated users.

**Impact:**

RPC clients will authenticate to the Endpoint Mapper Service for calls that contain
authentication information. Clients making such calls will not be able to communicate
with the Windows NT4 Server Endpoint Mapper Service.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed
by the following registry location with a REG_DWORD value of 1.

```

### 18.9.36.2 (L1) Ensure 'Restrict Unauthenticated RPC clients' is set to 'Enabled: Authenticated' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime handles unauthenticated RPC
clients connecting to RPC servers.

This policy setting impacts all RPC applications. In a domain environment this policy
setting should be used with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality
including group policy processing itself. Reverting a change to this policy setting can
require manual intervention on each affected machine. This policy setting should
**never be applied to a Domain Controller.**

A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to
communicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have
specifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from
this restriction, depending on the selected value for this policy setting.

-- "None" allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on
which the policy setting is applied.

-- "Authenticated" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to
connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied.
Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them.

-- "Authenticated without exceptions" allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the
definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy
setting is applied. No exceptions are allowed. This value has the potential to cause
**serious problems and is not recommended.**

**Note: This policy setting will not be applied until the system is rebooted.**

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Authenticated.

**Rationale:**

Unauthenticated RPC communication can create a security vulnerability.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 18.9.49.1 (L2) Ensure 'Turn off the advertising ID' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting turns off the advertising ID, preventing apps from using the ID for
experiences across apps.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Tracking user activity for advertising purposes, even anonymously, may be a privacy
concern. In an enterprise managed environment, applications should not need or
require tracking for targeted advertising.

**Impact:**

The advertising ID is turned off. Apps can't use the ID for experiences across apps.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed
by the following registry location with a REG_DWORD value of 1.

### 18.9.51.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enable Windows NTP Client' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether the Windows NTP Client is enabled. Enabling the
Windows NTP Client allows synchronization from a systems computer clock to NTP
server(s).

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: If a third-party time provider is used in the environment, an exception to this**
recommendation will be needed.

**Rationale:**

A reliable and accurate account of time is important for a number of services and
security requirements, including but not limited to distributed applications, authentication
services, multi-user databases and logging services. The use of an NTP client (with
secure operation) establishes functional accuracy and is a focal point when reviewing
security relevant events.

**Impact:**

System time will be synced to the configured NTP server(s).

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed
by the following registry location with a REG_DWORD value of 1.

```

### 18.9.51.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Enable Windows NTP Server' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether the Windows NTP Server is enabled. Disabling this
setting prevents the system from acting as a NTP Server (time source) to service NTP
requests from other systems (NTP Clients).

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

The configuration of proper time synchronization is critically important in an enterprise
managed environment both due to the sensitivity of Kerberos authentication timestamps
and also to ensure accurate security logging. This should be done through a known
NTP server. Member servers and workstations should not typically be time sources for
other clients.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 18.10.3.2 (L1) Ensure 'Prevent non-admin users from installing packaged Windows apps' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting manages non-Administrator users' ability to install Windows app packages.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

In a corporate managed environment, application installations should be managed
centrally by IT staff, not by end users.

**Impact:**

Non-Administrator users will not be able to install Microsoft Store app packages, unless
they are explicitly permitted by other policies. If a Microsoft Store app is required for
legitimate use, an Administrator will need to perform the installation from an
Administrator context.

This setting can prevent standard users (without Administrator access) from launching
Office 365 (O365) applications, displaying the error: "Windows cannot access the
_specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access_
_the item."_

### 18.10.5.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Microsoft accounts to be optional' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting lets you control whether Microsoft accounts are optional for Windows
Store apps that require an account to sign in. This policy only affects Windows Store
apps that support it.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Enabling this setting allows an organization to use their enterprise user accounts
instead of using their Microsoft accounts when accessing Windows store apps. This
provides the organization with greater control over relevant credentials. Microsoft
accounts cannot be centrally managed and as such enterprise credential security
policies cannot be applied to them, which could put any information accessed by using
Microsoft accounts at risk.

**Impact:**

Windows Store apps that typically require a Microsoft account to sign in will allow users
to sign in with an enterprise account instead.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether Microsoft Store apps with Windows Runtime API
access directly from web content can be launched.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Blocking apps from the web with direct access to the Windows API can prevent

### 18.10.7.2 (L1) Ensure 'Set the default behavior for AutoRun' is set to 'Enabled: Do not execute any autorun commands' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting sets the default behavior for Autorun commands. Autorun commands
are generally stored in autorun.inf files. They often launch the installation program or
other routines.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Do not execute any autorun
```
commands.

```
**Rationale:**

Prior to Windows Vista, when media containing an autorun command is inserted, the
system will automatically execute the program without user intervention. This creates a
major security concern as code may be executed without user's knowledge. The default
behavior starting with Windows Vista is to prompt the user whether autorun command is
to be run. The autorun command is represented as a handler in the Autoplay dialog.

**Impact:**

AutoRun commands will be completely disabled.

could use this feature to launch a program to damage the computer or data on the
computer. Autoplay is disabled by default on some removable drive types, such as
floppy disk and network drives, but not on CD-ROM drives.

**Note: You cannot use this policy setting to enable Autoplay on computer drives in which**
it is disabled by default, such as floppy disk and network drives.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: All drives.

**Rationale:**

An attacker could use this feature to launch a program to damage a client computer or
data on the computer.

**Impact:**

Autoplay will be disabled - users will have to manually launch setup or installation
programs that are provided on removable media.

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether enhanced anti-spoofing is configured for devices
which support it.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Enterprise managed environments are now supporting a wider range of mobile devices,
increasing the security on these devices will help protect against unauthorized access
on your network.

**Impact:**

Windows will require all users on the device to use anti-spoofing for facial features, on
devices which support it.

### 18.10.9.1.1 (BL) Ensure 'Allow access to BitLocker-protected fixed data drives from earlier versions of Windows' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting configures whether or not fixed data drives formatted with the FAT
file system can be unlocked and viewed on computers running Windows Server 2008
(non-R2), Windows Vista, Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3), or Windows XP with
Service Pack 2 (SP2) operating systems.

**Note: This policy setting does not apply to drives that are formatted with the NTFS file**
system.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

By default BitLocker virtualizes FAT formatted drives to permit access via the BitLocker
To Go Reader on previous versions of Windows. Additionally the BitLocker To Go
Reader application is applied to the unencrypted portion of the drive.

The BitLocker To Go Reader application, like any other application, is subject to
spoofing and could be a mechanism to propagate malware.

**Impact:**

Fixed data drives formatted with the FAT file system that are BitLocker-protected cannot
be unlocked on computers running Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), Windows Vista,
Windows XP with SP3 or Windows XP with SP2. BitLockerToGo.exe will not be
installed.

### 18.10.9.1.2 (BL) Ensure 'Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are
recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when
you turn on BitLocker.

The "Allow data recovery agent" check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery
Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected fixed data drives. Before a Data Recovery
Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the
Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult the
BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more
information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

In "Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information" select whether users are
allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit
recovery key.

Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to prevent users from
specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you
will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker,
instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services" choose
which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you
select "Backup recovery password and key package", both the BitLocker recovery
password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports
recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select "Backup
recovery password only", only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

Select the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for
fixed data drives" check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless
the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery
information to AD DS succeeds.

**Note: If the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for**
fixed data drives" check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically
generated.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Page 840


-----

**Rationale:**

Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the
event users cannot access their data.

Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by
guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

**Impact:**

To use BitLocker, a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for fixed drives. To
recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private
key.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed
by the following registry location with a REG_DWORD value of 1.

```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE:FDVRecovery

**Default Value:**

Disabled. (The default recovery options are supported for BitLocker recovery - a DRA is
allowed, and the recovery options can be specified by the user including the recovery
password and recovery key, and recovery information is not backed up to AD DS.)

### 18.10.9.1.8 (BL) Ensure 'Choose how BitLocker-protected fixed drives can be recovered: Configure storage of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS' is set to 'Enabled: Backup recovery passwords and key packages' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected fixed data drives are
recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied when
you turn on BitLocker.

In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services" choose
which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives. If you
select "Backup recovery password and key package", both the BitLocker recovery
password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports
recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select "Backup
recovery password only", only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Backup recovery passwords and
```
key packages.

```
**Rationale:**

Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the
event users cannot access their data.

Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by
guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

To use BitLocker, a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for fixed drives. To
recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private
key.

**Impact:**

None - this value is ignored when the checkbox above it (Save BitLocker recovery
_information to AD DS for fixed data drives) is False (unchecked), as is required in Rule_
18.9.11.1.7. If that checkbox is set to True (checked), both recovery passwords and key
packages for fixed drives will be saved to AD DS.

### 18.10.9.1.10 (BL) Ensure 'Configure use of hardware-based encryption for fixed data drives' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to manage BitLocker's use of hardware-based encryption
on fixed data drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with hardwarebased encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve performance of drive
operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive.

You can specify additional options that control whether BitLocker software-based
encryption is used instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not
support hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption
algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

From a security perspective hardware-based encryption may introduce vulnerabilities in
the hardware encryption of certain self-encrypting drives (SEDs), if the vendor and/or
user has not updated the firmware to remediate the vulnerability. For more information

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether a password is required to unlock BitLockerprotected fixed data drives.

**Note: This setting is enforced when turning on BitLocker, not when unlocking a volume.**
BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any of the protectors available on the drive.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Using a dictionary-style attack, passwords can be guessed or discovered by repeatedly
attempting to unlock a drive. Since this type of BitLocker password does include antidictionary attack protections provided by a TPM, for example, there is no mechanism to
slow down rapid brute-force attacks against them.

### 18.10.9.2.1 (BL) Ensure 'Allow enhanced PINs for startup' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to configure whether or not enhanced startup PINs are
used with BitLocker.

Enhanced startup PINs permit the use of characters including uppercase and lowercase
letters, symbols, numbers, and spaces. This policy setting is applied when you turn on
BitLocker.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

A numeric-only PIN provides less entropy than a PIN that is alpha-numeric. When not
using enhanced PIN for startup, BitLocker requires the use of the function keys [F1-F10]
for PIN entry since the PIN is entered in the pre-OS environment before localization
support is available. This limits each PIN digit to one of ten possibilities. The TPM has
an anti-hammering feature that includes a mechanism to exponentially increase the
delay for PIN retry attempts; however, an attacker is able to more effectively mount a
brute force attack using a domain of 10 digits of the function keys.

**Impact:**

All new BitLocker startup PINs set will be enhanced PINs.

**Note: Not all computers enable full keyboard support in the Pre-OS environment. Some**
keys may not be available. It is recommended this functionality be tested using the
computers in your environment prior to it being deployed.

### 18.10.9.2.2 (BL) Ensure 'Allow Secure Boot for integrity validation' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to configure whether Secure Boot will be allowed as the
platform integrity provider for BitLocker operating system drives.

Secure Boot ensures that the PC's pre-boot environment only loads firmware that is
digitally signed by authorized software publishers. Secure Boot also provides more
flexibility for managing pre-boot configuration than legacy BitLocker integrity checks.

Secure Boot requires a system that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 Specifications for Class 2 and
Class 3 computers.

When this policy is enabled and the hardware is capable of using Secure Boot for
BitLocker scenarios, the "Use enhanced Boot Configuration Data validation profile"
group policy setting is ignored and Secure Boot verifies BCD settings according to the
Secure Boot policy setting, which is configured separately from BitLocker.

**Note: If the group policy setting "Configure TPM platform validation profile for native**
UEFI firmware configurations" is enabled and has PCR 7 omitted, BitLocker will be
prevented from using Secure Boot for platform or Boot Configuration Data (BCD)
integrity validation.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Secure Boot ensures that only firmware digitally signed by authorized software
publishers is loaded during computer startup, which reduces the risk of rootkits and
other types of malware from gaining control of the system. It also helps provide
protection against malicious users booting from an alternate operating system.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 18.10.9.2.3 (BL) Ensure 'Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system
drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy
setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The "Allow certificate-based data recovery agent" check box is used to specify whether
a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected operating system drives.
Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key
Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy
Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet
for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

In "Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information" select whether users are
allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit
recovery key.

Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to prevent users from
specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you
will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker,
instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services", choose
which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for operating system drives. If
you select "Backup recovery password and key package", both the BitLocker recovery
password and key package are stored in AD DS. Storing the key package supports
recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted. If you select "Backup
recovery password only", only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

Select the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for
operating system drives" check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker
unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery
information to AD DS succeeds.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or
should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into
recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user
would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash
drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in
order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the
user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is
stored there.

**Impact:**

Users will need to be domain connected to turn on BitLocker. This policy is not FIPS
complaint.

### 18.10.9.2.4 (BL) Ensure 'Choose how BitLocker-protected operating system drives can be recovered: Allow data recovery agent' is set to 'Enabled: False' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected operating system
drives are recovered in the absence of the required startup key information. This policy
setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The "Allow certificate-based data recovery agent" check box is used to specify whether
a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected operating system drives.
Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key
Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy
Editor. Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet
for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: False (unchecked).

**Rationale:**

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or
should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into
recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user
would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash
drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in
order to recovery the system. If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the
user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is
stored there.

**Impact:**

A Data Recovery Agent will not be permitted for the operating system drive. Users will
need to be domain connected to turn on BitLocker. This policy is not FIPS complaint.

will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker,
instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: True (checked).

**Rationale:**

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or
should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into
recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user
would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to manage BitLocker's use of hardware-based encryption
on operating system drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with
hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve
performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the
drive.

You can specify additional options that control whether BitLocker software-based
encryption is used instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not
support hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption
algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

From a security perspective hardware-based encryption may introduce vulnerabilities in
the hardware encryption of certain self-encrypting drives (SEDs), if the vendor and/or
user has not updated the firmware to remediate the vulnerability. For more information

### 18.10.9.2.12 (BL) Ensure 'Configure use of passwords for operating system drives' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies the constraints for passwords used to unlock BitLockerprotected operating system drives.

**Note: This setting is enforced when turning on BitLocker, not when unlocking a volume.**
BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any of the protectors available on the drive.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Using a dictionary-style attack, passwords can be guessed or discovered by repeatedly
attempting to unlock a drive. Since this type of BitLocker password does include antidictionary attack protections provided by a TPM, for example, there is no mechanism to
slow down rapid brute-force attacks against them.

**Impact:**

The password option will not be available when configuring BitLocker for the operating
system drive.

### 18.10.9.2.13 (BL) Ensure 'Require additional authentication at startup' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires additional
authentication each time the computer starts and whether you are using BitLocker with
or without a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This policy setting is applied when you
turn on BitLocker.

**Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be required at startup,**
otherwise a policy error occurs.

If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the "Allow BitLocker
without a compatible TPM" check box. In this mode a USB drive is required for start-up
and the key information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a
USB key. When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the
drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use one of the
BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.

On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be
used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer
starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a
USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal
identification number (PIN), or both.

Users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard.

**Note #2: If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must**
configure BitLocker settings using the command-line tool manage-bde instead of the
BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

TPM without use of a PIN will only validate early boot components and does not require
a user to enter any additional authentication information. If a computer is lost or stolen
in this configuration, BitLocker will not provide any additional measure of protection
beyond what is provided by native Windows authentication unless the early boot
components are tampered with or the encrypted drive is removed from the machine.

**Impact:**

A PIN requires physical presence to restart the computer. This functionality is not

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting configures whether or not removable data drives formatted with the
FAT file system can be unlocked and viewed on computers running Windows Server
2008 (non-R2), Windows Vista, Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3), or Windows
XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2) operating systems.

**Note: This policy setting does not apply to drives that are formatted with the NTFS file**
system.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

By default BitLocker virtualizes FAT formatted drives to permit access via the BitLocker
To Go Reader on previous versions of Windows. Additionally the BitLocker To Go
Reader application is applied to the unencrypted portion of the drive.

The BitLocker To Go Reader application, like any other application, is subject to
spoofing and could be a mechanism to propagate malware.

**Impact:**

Removable data drives formatted with the FAT file system that are BitLocker-protected
cannot be unlocked on computers running Windows Server 2008 (non-R2), Windows
Vista, Windows XP with SP3 or Windows XP with SP2. BitLockerToGo.exe will not be

### 18.10.9.3.2 (BL) Ensure 'Choose how BitLocker-protected removable drives can be recovered' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected removable data drives
are recovered in the absence of the required credentials. This policy setting is applied
when you turn on BitLocker.

The "Allow data recovery agent" check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery
Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected removable data drives. Before a Data
Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in
either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor. Consult
the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more
information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

In "Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information" select whether users are
allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit
recovery key.

Select "Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard" to prevent users from
specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive. This means that you
will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker,
instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

In "Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services" choose
which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for removable data drives. If you
select "Backup recovery password and key package", both the BitLocker recovery
password and key package are stored in AD DS. If you select "Backup recovery
password only", only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

Select the "Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for
removable data drives" check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker
unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery

**Rationale:**

Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the
event users cannot access their data.

Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by
guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

**Impact:**

To use BitLocker a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for removable
drives. To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery
Agent private key.

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to manage BitLocker's use of hardware-based encryption
on removable data drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with
hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve
performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the
drive.

You can specify additional options that control whether BitLocker software-based
encryption is used instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not
support hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption
algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

From a security perspective hardware-based encryption may introduce vulnerabilities in
the hardware encryption of certain self-encrypting drives (SEDs), if the vendor and/or
user has not updated the firmware to remediate the vulnerability. For more information

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to specify whether a password is required to unlock
BitLocker-protected removable data drives.

**Note: This setting is enforced when turning on BitLocker, not when unlocking a drive.**
BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any of the protectors available on the drive.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Using a dictionary-style attack, passwords can be guessed or discovered by repeatedly
attempting to unlock a drive. Since this type of BitLocker password does not include
anti-dictionary attack protections provided by a TPM, for example, there is no
mechanism to slow down use of rapid brute-force attacks against them.

### 18.10.9.3.12 (BL) Ensure 'Configure use of smart cards on removable data drives' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether smart cards can be used to authenticate user
access to BitLocker-protected removable data drives on a computer.

Smart cards can be used to authenticate user access to the drive. You can require
smart card authentication by selecting the "Require use of smart cards on removable
data drives" check box.

**Note: This setting is enforced when turning on BitLocker, not when unlocking a volume.**
BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any of the protectors available on the drive.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

A drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used
to access the drive. For example, a password could be guessed, or a drive set to
automatically unlock could be lost or stolen with the computer it automatically unlocks
with.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed
by the following registry location with a REG_DWORD value of 1.

```

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether smart cards must be used to authenticate user
access to BitLocker-protected removable data drives on a computer.

Smart cards can be used to authenticate user access to the drive. You can require
smart card authentication by selecting the "Require use of smart cards on removable

**Note: This setting is enforced when turning on BitLocker, not when unlocking a volume.**
BitLocker will allow unlocking a drive with any of the protectors available on the drive.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: True (checked).

**Rationale:**

A drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used
to access the drive. For example, a password could be guessed, or a drive set to
automatically unlock could be lost or stolen with the computer it automatically unlocks
with.

**Impact:**

Smart cards will be required to authenticate user access to removable data drives. Use
of smart cards requires PKI infrastructure. Users will need to authenticate with the smart
card to unlock the removable data drive every time they restart the computer.

### 18.10.9.4 (BL) Ensure 'Disable new DMA devices when this computer is locked' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) + BitLocker (BL)

- Level 2 (L2) + BitLocker (BL)

- BitLocker (BL) - optional add-on for when BitLocker is deployed

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to block direct memory access (DMA) for all hot pluggable
PCI downstream ports until a user logs into Windows.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: Microsoft changed the implementation of this setting in Windows 10 R1709 to**
strengthen its enforcement. As a result, some hardware configurations may experience
unexpected problems with this setting in that release (or newer), until updated firmware
and/or drivers from the vendor are installed to correct the problem. See the Impact
Statement for more information.

**Rationale:**

A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA)
attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes
when the workstation is locked. Enabling this setting will help prevent such an attack
while the computer is left unattended.

**Impact:**

Newly attached hardware devices that use DMA will not function on a locked (or signed
out) workstation until the user has unlocked the session or logged in. Some hardware
configurations may experience unexpected problems with this setting in Windows 10
R1709 (or newer), requiring updated firmware and/or drivers to correct the problem. See
[MSKB 4057300](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4057300/devices-not-working-before-log-on-a-computer-running-windows-10-1709) for more information. We recommend testing this setting on all
examples of workstation hardware before deploying it on a large scale - to see if vendor
firmware and/or driver updates are first required.

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether cloud consumer account state content is allowed
in all Windows experiences.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

The use of consumer accounts in an enterprise managed environment is not good
security practice as it could lead to possible data leakage.

This policy setting allows you to configure the display of the password reveal button in
password entry user experiences.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

This is a useful feature when entering a long and complex password, especially when
using a touchscreen. The potential risk is that someone else may see your password
while surreptitiously observing your screen.

**Impact:**

The password reveal button will not be displayed after a user types a password in the
password entry text box.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

```
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CredUI:DisablePasswordReveal

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```
Enabled:

### 18.10.14.2 (L1) Ensure 'Enumerate administrator accounts on elevation' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether administrator accounts are displayed when a user
attempts to elevate a running application.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Users could see the list of administrator accounts, making it slightly easier for a
malicious user who has logged onto a console session to try to crack the passwords of
those accounts.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

### 18.10.14.3 (L1) Ensure 'Prevent the use of security questions for local accounts' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether security questions can be used to reset local
account passwords. The security question feature does not apply to domain accounts,
only local accounts on the workstation.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Users could establish security questions that are easily guessed or sleuthed by
observing the user’s social media accounts, making it easier for a malicious actor to
change the local user account password and gain access to the computer as that user
account.

**Impact:**

Local user accounts will not be able to set up and use security questions to reset their
passwords.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```

### 18.10.15.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Diagnostic Data' is set to 'Enabled: Diagnostic data off (not recommended)' or 'Enabled: Send required diagnostic data' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines the amount of diagnostic and usage data reported to
Microsoft:

  - A value of (0) Diagnostic data off (not recommended). Using this value, no
diagnostic data is sent from the device. This value is only supported on
Enterprise, Education, and Server editions. If you choose this setting, devices in
your organization will still be secure.

  - A value of (1) Send required diagnostic data. This is the minimum diagnostic
data necessary to keep Windows secure, up to date, and performing as
expected. Using this value disables the Optional diagnostic data control in the
Settings app.

  - A value of (3) Send optional diagnostic data. Additional diagnostic data is
collected that helps us to detect, diagnose and fix issues, as well as make
product improvements. Required diagnostic data will always be included when
you choose to send optional diagnostic data. Optional diagnostic data can also
include diagnostic log files and crash dumps. Use the Limit Dump Collection and
the Limit Diagnostic Log Collection policies for more granular control of what
optional diagnostic data is sent.

Windows telemetry settings apply to the Windows operating system and some first party
apps. This setting does not apply to third party apps running on Windows 10/11.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Diagnostic data off (not
```
recommended) or Enabled: Send required diagnostic data.

```
**Note: If your organization relies on Windows Update, the minimum recommended**
setting is Required diagnostic data. Because no Windows Update information is
collected when diagnostic data is off, important information about update failures is not
sent. Microsoft uses this information to fix the causes of those failures and improve the
quality of updates.

**Note #2: The Configure diagnostic data opt-in settings user interface group policy can**
be used to prevent end users from changing their data collection settings.

Page 958


-----

**Note #3: Enhanced diagnostic data setting is not available on Windows 11 and**
Windows Server 2022 and has been replaced with policies that can control the amount
of optional diagnostic data that is sent. For more information on these settings visit
[Manage diagnostic data using Group Policy and MDM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization#manage-diagnostic-data-using-group-policy-and-mdm)

**Rationale:**

Sending any data to a third-party vendor is a security concern and should only be done
on an as needed basis.

**Impact:**

Note that setting values of 0 or 1 will degrade certain experiences on the device.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0 or 1.

```
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection:AllowTelemetry

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```
Enabled: Diagnostic data off (not recommended) or Enabled: Send required
diagnostic data:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows
Components\Data Collection and Preview Builds\Allow Diagnostic Data

```
**Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template**
```
DataCollection.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 RTM

```
(Release 1507) Administrative Templates (or newer).

**Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially**
named Allow Telemetry, but it was renamed to Allow Diagnostic Data starting with the
Windows 11 Release 21H2 Administrative Templates.

**Default Value:**

Disabled. (The device will send required diagnostic data and the end user can choose
whether to send optional diagnostic data from the Settings app.)

### 18.10.15.8 (L1) Ensure 'Toggle user control over Insider builds' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether users can access the Insider build controls in the
Advanced Options for Windows Update. These controls are located under "Get Insider
builds," and enable users to make their devices available for downloading and installing
Windows preview software.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: This policy setting applies only to devices running Windows 10 Pro or Windows**
10 Enterprise, up until Release 1703. For Release 1709 or newer, Microsoft encourages
using the Manage preview builds setting (Section 18.10.92). We have kept this setting
in the benchmark to ensure that any older builds of Windows 10 in the environment are
still enforced.

**Rationale:**

It can be risky for experimental features to be allowed in an enterprise managed
environment because this can introduce bugs and security holes into systems, making it
easier for an attacker to gain access. It is generally preferred to only use productionready builds.

**Impact:**

The item "Get Insider builds" will be unavailable.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 18.10.16.1 (L1) Ensure 'Download Mode' is NOT set to 'Enabled: Internet' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies the download method that Delivery Optimization can use in
downloads of Windows Updates, Apps and App updates. The following methods are
supported:

  - 0 = HTTP only, no peering.

  - 1 = HTTP blended with peering behind the same NAT.

  - 2 = HTTP blended with peering across a private group. Peering occurs on
devices in the same Active Directory Site (if exist) or the same domain by default.
When this option is selected, peering will cross NATs. To create a custom group
use Group ID in combination with Mode 2.

  - 3 = HTTP blended with Internet Peering.

  - 99 = Simple download mode with no peering. Delivery Optimization downloads
using HTTP only and does not attempt to contact the Delivery Optimization cloud
services.

  - 100 = Bypass mode. Do not use Delivery Optimization and use BITS instead.

The recommended state for this setting is any value EXCEPT: Enabled: Internet (3).

**Note: The default on all SKUs other than Enterprise, Enterprise LTSB or Education is**
```
Enabled: Internet (3), so on other SKUs, be sure to set this to a different value.

```
**Rationale:**

Due to privacy concerns and security risks, updates should only be downloaded directly
from Microsoft, or from a trusted machine on the internal network that received its
updates from a trusted source and approved by the network administrator.

**Impact:**

Machines will not be able to download updates from peers on the Internet. If set to
```
Enabled: HTTP only (0), Enabled: Simple (99), or Enabled: Bypass (100), machines

```
will not be able to download updates from other machines on the same LAN.

### 18.10.25.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Application: Specify the maximum log file size (KB)' is set to 'Enabled: 32,768 or greater' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies the maximum size of the log file in kilobytes. The maximum
log file size can be configured between 1 megabyte (1,024 kilobytes) and 4 terabytes
(4,194,240 kilobytes) in kilobyte increments.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 32,768 or greater.

**Rationale:**

If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of
system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users.

**Impact:**

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention
method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the
most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the
retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.

The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the
logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate
a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These
risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log
data.

Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft
System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool.
Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring
server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

### 18.10.25.3.2 (L1) Ensure 'Setup: Specify the maximum log file size (KB)' is set to 'Enabled: 32,768 or greater' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies the maximum size of the log file in kilobytes. The maximum
log file size can be configured between 1 megabyte (1,024 kilobytes) and 4 terabytes
(4,194,240 kilobytes) in kilobyte increments.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 32,768 or greater.

**Rationale:**

If events are not recorded it may be difficult or impossible to determine the root cause of
system problems or the unauthorized activities of malicious users

**Impact:**

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention
method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the
most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the
retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed.

The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the
logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate
a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These
risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log
data.

Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft
System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool.
Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully
compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring
server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities.

### 18.10.28.5 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off shell protocol protected mode' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to configure the amount of functionality that the shell
protocol can have. When using the full functionality of this protocol, applications can
open folders and launch files. The protected mode reduces the functionality of this
protocol allowing applications to only open a limited set of folders. Applications are not
able to open files with this protocol when it is in the protected mode. It is recommended
to leave this protocol in the protected mode to increase the security of Windows.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Limiting the opening of files and folders to a limited set reduces the attack surface of the
system.

### 18.10.36.1 (L2) Ensure 'Turn off location' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting turns off the location feature for the computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

This setting affects the location feature (e.g. GPS or other location tracking). From a
security perspective, it’s not a good idea to reveal your location to software in most
cases, but there are legitimate uses, such as mapping software. However, they should
not be used in high security environments.

### 18.10.40.1 (L2) Ensure 'Allow Message Service Cloud Sync' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows backup and restore of cellular text messages to Microsoft's
cloud services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

In a high security environment, data should never be sent to any third-party since this
data could contain sensitive information.

**Impact:**

Cellular text messages will not be backed up to (or restored from) Microsoft's cloud
services.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

```
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Messaging:AllowMessageSync

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```

### 18.10.41.1 (L1) Ensure 'Block all consumer Microsoft account user authentication' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting determines whether applications and services on the device can utilize new
consumer Microsoft account authentication via the Windows OnlineID and
```
WebAccountManager APIs.

```
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Organizations that want to effectively implement identity management policies and
maintain firm control of what accounts are used on their computers will probably want to
block Microsoft accounts. Organizations may also need to block Microsoft accounts in
order to meet the requirements of compliance standards that apply to their information
systems.

**Impact:**

All applications and services on the device will be prevented from new authentications
using consumer Microsoft accounts via the Windows OnlineID and WebAccountManager
APIs. Authentications performed directly by the user in web browsers or in apps that
use OAuth will remain unaffected.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

```
```

### 18.10.42.5.1 (L1) Ensure 'Configure local setting override for reporting to Microsoft MAPS' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting configures a local override for the configuration to join Microsoft
Active Protection Service (MAPS), which Microsoft renamed to Windows Defender
_Antivirus Cloud Protection Service and then Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud_
_Protection Service. This setting can only be set by Group Policy._

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

The decision on whether or not to participate in Microsoft MAPS / Microsoft Defender
Antivirus Cloud Protection Service for malicious software reporting should be made
centrally in an enterprise managed environment, so that all computers within it behave
consistently in that regard. Configuring this setting to Disabled ensures that the decision
remains centrally managed.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

### 18.10.42.5.2 (L2) Ensure 'Join Microsoft MAPS' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS), which
Microsoft renamed to Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service and then
_Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service. Microsoft MAPS / Microsoft_
Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service is the online community that helps you
choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread
of new malicious software infections. You can choose to send basic or additional
information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new
definitions and help it to protect your computer.

Possible options are:

  - (0x0) Disabled (default)

  - (0x1) Basic membership

  - (0x2) Advanced membership

**Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has**
been detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or
that are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful.

**Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to**
Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including
the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has
impacted your computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

The information that would be sent can include things like location of detected items on
your computer if harmful software was removed. The information would be automatically
collected and sent. In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent
to Microsoft. However, Microsoft states that it will not use this information to identify you
or contact you.

For privacy reasons in high security environments, it is best to prevent these data
submissions altogether.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 18.10.42.7.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enable file hash computation feature' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting determines whether hash values are computed for files scanned by
Microsoft Defender.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

When running an antivirus solution such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus, it is important
to ensure that it is configured to monitor for suspicious and known malicious activity.
File hashes are a reliable way of detecting changes to files, and can speed up the scan
process by skipping files that have not changed since they were last scanned and
determined to be safe. A changed file hash can also be cause for additional scrutiny.

**Impact:**

This setting could cause performance degradation during initial deployment and for
users where new executable content is frequently being created (such as software
developers), or where applications are frequently installed or updated.

[For more information on this setting, please visit Security baseline (FINAL): Windows 10](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/security-baseline-final-windows-10-and-windows-server-version/ba-p/1543631)

### 18.10.42.13.2 (L1) Ensure 'Scan removable drives' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting manages whether or not to scan for malicious software and
unwanted software in the contents of removable drives, such as USB flash drives, when
running a full scan.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

It is important to ensure that any present removable drives are always included in any
type of scan, as removable drives are more likely to contain malicious software brought
in to the enterprise managed environment from an external, unmanaged computer.

**Impact:**

Removable drives will be scanned during any type of scan by Microsoft Defender
Antivirus.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows

### 18.10.42.13.3 (L1) Ensure 'Turn on e-mail scanning' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting configures e-mail scanning. When e-mail scanning is enabled, the
engine will parse the mailbox and mail files, according to their specific format, in order to
analyze the mail bodies and attachments. Several e-mail formats are currently
supported, for example: pst (Outlook), dbx, mbx, mime (Outlook Express), binhex
(Mac).

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Incoming e-mails should be scanned by an antivirus solution such as Microsoft
Defender Antivirus, as email attachments are a commonly used attack vector to infiltrate
computers with malicious software.

**Impact:**

E-mail scanning by Microsoft Defender Antivirus will be enabled.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 18.10.42.16 (L1) Ensure 'Configure detection for potentially unwanted applications' is set to 'Enabled: Block' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls detection and action for Potentially Unwanted Applications
(PUA), which are sneaky unwanted application bundlers or their bundled applications,
that can deliver adware or malware.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Block.

[For more information, see this link: Block potentially unwanted applications with](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/detect-block-potentially-unwanted-apps-windows-defender-antivirus)
[Microsoft Defender Antivirus | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/detect-block-potentially-unwanted-apps-windows-defender-antivirus)

**Rationale:**

Potentially unwanted applications can increase the risk of your network being infected
with malware, cause malware infections to be harder to identify, and can waste IT
resources in cleaning up the applications. They should be blocked from installation.

**Impact:**

Applications that are identified by Microsoft as PUA will be blocked at download and
install time.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 18.10.42.17 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off Microsoft Defender AntiVirus' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting turns off Microsoft Defender Antivirus. If the setting is configured to
Disabled, Microsoft Defender Antivirus runs and computers are scanned for malware
and other potentially unwanted software.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

It is important to ensure a current, updated antivirus product is scanning each computer
for malicious file activity. Microsoft provides a competent solution out of the box in
Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

Organizations that choose to purchase a reputable third-party antivirus solution may
choose to exempt themselves from this recommendation in lieu of the commercial
alternative.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

### 18.10.43.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow auditing events in Microsoft Defender Application Guard' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to decide whether auditing events can be collected from
Microsoft Defender Application Guard.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: Microsoft Defender Application Guard requires a 64-bit version of Windows and a**
CPU supporting hardware-assisted CPU virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). This
feature is not officially supported on virtual hardware, although it can work on VMs
(especially for testing) provided that the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature is
exposed by the host to the guest VM.

[More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at System](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/reqs-wd-app-guard)
[requirements for Microsoft Defender Application Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/reqs-wd-app-guard)

**Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using**
Azure IaaS VMs.

**Rationale:**

Auditing of Microsoft Defender Application Guard events may be useful when
investigating a security incident.

**Impact:**

**Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1)**
profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only. NG profile settings were isolated
from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11
Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware
compatibility is no longer an issue.

Microsoft Defender Application Guard will inherit its auditing policies from Microsoft
Edge and start to audit system events specifically for Microsoft Defender Application
Guard. Collected logs are available for review on Microsoft Edge, outside of Application
Guard.

### 18.10.43.2 (L1) Ensure 'Allow camera and microphone access in Microsoft Defender Application Guard' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

The policy allows you to determine whether applications inside Microsoft Defender
Application Guard can access the device’s camera and microphone.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: Microsoft Defender Application Guard requires a 64-bit version of Windows and a**
CPU supporting hardware-assisted CPU virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). This
feature is not officially supported on virtual hardware, although it can work on VMs
(especially for testing) provided that the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature is
exposed by the host to the guest VM.

[More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at System](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/reqs-wd-app-guard)
[requirements for Microsoft Defender Application Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/reqs-wd-app-guard)

**Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using**
Azure IaaS VMs.

**Rationale:**

In effort to stop sensitive information from being obtained for malicious use, untrusted
sites within the Microsoft Defender Application Guard container should not be accessing
the computers microphone or camera.

**Impact:**

**Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1)**
profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only. NG profile settings were isolated
from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11
Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware
compatibility is no longer an issue.

This is the default value so impact should be minimal to enforce this setting.

### 18.10.43.3 (L1) Ensure 'Allow data persistence for Microsoft Defender Application Guard' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to decide whether data should persist across different
sessions in Microsoft Defender Application Guard.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: Microsoft Defender Application Guard requires a 64-bit version of Windows and a**
CPU supporting hardware-assisted CPU virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). This
feature is not officially supported on virtual hardware, although it can work on VMs
(especially for testing) provided that the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature is
exposed by the host to the guest VM.

[requirements for Microsoft Defender Application Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/reqs-wd-app-guard)

**Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using**
Azure IaaS VMs.

**Rationale:**

The primary purpose of Microsoft Defender Application Guard is to present a
"sandboxed container" for visiting untrusted websites. If data persistence is allowed,
then it reduces the effectiveness of the sandboxing, and malicious content will be able
to remain active in the Microsoft Defender Application Guard container between
sessions.

**Impact:**

**Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1)**
profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only. NG profile settings were isolated
from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11

### 18.10.43.5 (L1) Ensure 'Configure Microsoft Defender Application Guard clipboard settings: Clipboard behavior setting' is set to 'Enabled: Enable clipboard operation from an isolated session to the host' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to decide how the clipboard behaves while in Microsoft
Defender Application Guard.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Enable clipboard operation from
```
an isolated session to the host.

```
**Note: Microsoft Defender Application Guard requires a 64-bit version of Windows and a**
CPU supporting hardware-assisted CPU virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). This
feature is not officially supported on virtual hardware, although it can work on VMs
(especially for testing) provided that the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature is
exposed by the host to the guest VM.

[More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at System](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/reqs-wd-app-guard)
[requirements for Microsoft Defender Application Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/reqs-wd-app-guard)

**Note #2: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using**
Azure IaaS VMs.

**Rationale:**

The primary purpose of Microsoft Defender Application Guard is to present a
"sandboxed container" for visiting untrusted websites. If the host clipboard is made
available to Microsoft Defender Application Guard, a compromised Microsoft Defender
Application Guard session will have access to its content, potentially exposing sensitive
information to a malicious website or application. However, the risk is reduced if the
Microsoft Defender Application Guard clipboard is made accessible to the host, and
indeed that functionality may often be necessary from an operational standpoint.

Page 1078


-----

**Impact:**

**Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1)**
profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only. NG profile settings were isolated
from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11
Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware
compatibility is no longer an issue.

Microsoft Defender Application Guard sessions will not be able to access the host
device's clipboard, however the host device will be able to access the Microsoft
Defender Application Guard session clipboard.

### 18.10.43.6 (L1) Ensure 'Turn on Microsoft Defender Application Guard in Managed Mode' is set to 'Enabled: 1' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting enables application isolation through Microsoft Defender Application
Guard (Application Guard).

There are 4 options available:

1. Disable Microsoft Defender Application Guard

2. Enable Microsoft Defender Application Guard for Microsoft Edge ONLY

3. Enable Microsoft Defender Application Guard for Microsoft Office ONLY
4. Enable Microsoft Defender Application Guard for Microsoft Edge AND

Microsoft Office

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 1 (Enable Microsoft Defender
Application Guard for Microsoft Edge ONLY).

**Note: Microsoft Defender Application Guard requires a 64-bit version of Windows and a**
CPU supporting hardware-assisted CPU virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). This
feature is not officially supported on virtual hardware, although it can work on VMs
(especially for testing) provided that the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature is

[requirements for Microsoft Defender Application Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-guard/reqs-wd-app-guard)

**Note #2: At time of publication, Microsoft Defender Application Guard in all currently**
released versions of Windows 10 does not yet support protection for Microsoft Office,
only for Microsoft Edge. Therefore the additional available options of 2 and 3 in this
setting are not yet valid.

**Note #3: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using**
Azure IaaS VMs.

**Rationale:**

Microsoft Defender Application Guard uses Windows Hypervisor to create a virtualized
environment for apps that are configured to use virtualization-based security isolation.
While in isolation, improper user interactions and app vulnerabilities can’t compromise
the kernel or any other apps running outside of the virtualized environment.

Page 1081


-----

**Impact:**

Microsoft Defender Application Guard will be turned on for Microsoft Edge.

**Note: This setting was moved from the Next Generation (NG) profile to the Level 1 (L1)**
profile for the Windows 11 Operating System only. NG profile settings were isolated
from the L1 profile due to potential hardware compatibility issues. The Windows 11
Operating System is dependent on the same hardware as the NG settings, so hardware
compatibility is no longer an issue.

**Note #2: Microsoft Defender Application Guard requires the Internet Connection**
_Sharing (ICS) (SharedAccess) service in order to operate, so an exception to disabling_
this service (see Section 5) will be required if choosing to enable Microsoft Defender
Application Guard.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

### 18.10.49.1 (L2) Ensure 'Enable news and interests on the taskbar' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether the news and interests feature is allowed on the
device.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Due to privacy concerns, apps and features such as news and interests on the
Windows taskbar should be treated as a possible security risk due to the potential of
data being sent back to third-parties, such as Microsoft.

In addition, the app may display inappropriate news and interests within the feed.

**Impact:**

The news and interests feature on the Windows taskbar will not be available on the
device.

**Note: At time of benchmark publication, this setting does not hide or disable the taskbar**
menu options for the news and interests feature, however attempting to turn the feature
back on does not cause any visible change. It is possible that Microsoft will modify this
behavior to "gray out" the taskbar menu options in a future OS update.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 18.10.50.1 (L1) Ensure 'Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting lets you prevent apps and features from working with files on
OneDrive using the Next Generation Sync Client.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Enabling this setting prevents users from accidentally (or intentionally) uploading
confidential or sensitive corporate information to the OneDrive cloud service using the
Next Generation Sync Client.

**Note: This security concern applies to any cloud-based file storage application installed**
on a workstation, not just the one supplied with Windows.

Page 1089


-----

**Impact:**

Users can't access OneDrive from the OneDrive app and file picker. Windows Store
apps can't access OneDrive using the WinRT API. OneDrive doesn't appear in the
navigation pane in File Explorer. OneDrive files aren't kept in sync with the cloud. Users
can't automatically upload photos and videos from the camera roll folder.

**Note: If your organization uses Office 365, be aware that this setting will prevent users**
from saving files to OneDrive/SkyDrive.

**Note #2: If your organization has decided to implement OneDrive for Business and**
therefore needs to except itself from this recommendation, we highly suggest that you
also obtain and utilize the OneDrive.admx/adml template that is bundled with the latest
[OneDrive client, as noted at this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/use-group-policy) (this template is not included with the Windows
Administrative Templates). Two alternative OneDrive settings in particular from that
template are worth your consideration:

  - _Allow syncing OneDrive accounts for only specific organizations - a computer-_
based setting that restricts OneDrive client connections to only approved tenant
IDs.

  - _Prevent users from synchronizing personal OneDrive accounts - a user-based_
setting that prevents use of consumer OneDrive (i.e. non-business).

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

```
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\OneDrive:DisableFileSyncNGSC

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```

```
**Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template**

Administrative Templates (or newer). However, we strongly recommend you only use
the version included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1607 & Server 2016
Administrative Templates (or newer). Older versions of the templates had conflicting
settings in different template files for both OneDrive & SkyDrive, until it was cleaned up
properly in the above version.

**Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was named**
_Prevent the usage of SkyDrive for file storage, but it was renamed starting with the_
Windows 10 RTM (Release 1507) Administrative Templates.

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether data transferred from the remote session to the

### 18.10.56.2.3 (L1) Ensure 'Do not allow passwords to be saved' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting helps prevent Remote Desktop clients from saving passwords on a
computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: If this policy setting was previously configured as Disabled or Not configured, any**
previously saved passwords will be deleted the first time a Remote Desktop client
disconnects from any server.

**Rationale:**

An attacker with physical access to the computer may be able to break the protection
guarding saved passwords. An attacker who compromises a user's account and
connects to their computer could use saved passwords to gain access to additional
hosts.

**Impact:**

The password saving checkbox will be disabled for Remote Desktop clients and users
will not be able to save passwords.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal

```
**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```

### 18.10.56.3.2.1 (L2) Ensure 'Allow users to connect remotely by using Remote Desktop Services' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to configure remote access to computers by using
Remote Desktop Services.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Any account with the Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services user right can log
on to the remote console of the computer. If you do not restrict access to legitimate
users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users could
download and execute malicious code to elevate their privileges.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default configuration, unless Remote Desktop Services has been
manually enabled on the Remote tab in the System Properties sheet.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 18.10.56.3.3.1 (L2) Ensure 'Allow UI Automation redirection' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether User Interface (UI) Automation client
applications running on the local computer can access UI elements on the server.

UI Automation gives programs access to most UI elements, which allows use of
assistive technology products like Magnifier and Narrator that need to interact with the
UI in order to work properly. UI information also allows automated test scripts to interact
with the UI. For example, the local computer´s Narrator and Magnifier clients can be
used to interact with UI on a web page opened in a remote session.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: Remote Desktop sessions don´t currently support UI Automation redirection.**

**Rationale:**

In a more security-sensitive environment, it is desirable to reduce the possible attack
surface. The need for UI Automation redirection within a Remote Desktop session is
rare, and not supported at this time, but it makes sense to reduce the number of
unexpected avenues for malicious activity to occur.

**Impact:**

UI Automation clients on the local computer will not be able to interact with remote
apps.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

### 18.10.56.3.3.3 (L1) Ensure 'Do not allow drive redirection' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting prevents users from sharing the local drives on their client computers
to Remote Desktop Servers that they access. Mapped drives appear in the session
folder tree in Windows Explorer in the following format:
```
\\TSClient\<driveletter>$

```
If local drives are shared they are left vulnerable to intruders who want to exploit the
data that is stored on them.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Data could be forwarded from the user's Remote Desktop Services session to the user's
local computer without any direct user interaction. Malicious software already present
on a compromised server would have direct and stealthy disk access to the user's local
computer during the Remote Desktop session.

**Impact:**

Drive redirection will not be possible. In most situations, traditional network drive
mapping to file shares (including administrative shares) performed manually by the
connected user will serve as a capable substitute to still allow file transfers when
needed.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

In a more security-sensitive environment, it is desirable to reduce the possible attack

from a Remote Desktop session to the local device. This redirection enables users to
authenticate to resources inside the Remote Desktop session using their
local authenticator (e.g. Windows Hello for Business, security key, or other).

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

In a more security-sensitive environment, it is desirable to reduce the possible attack
surface. To reduce this, resources inside the Remote Desktop session should not be

### 18.10.56.3.9.1 (L1) Ensure 'Always prompt for password upon connection' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether Remote Desktop Services always prompts the
client computer for a password upon connection. You can use this policy setting to
enforce a password prompt for users who log on to Remote Desktop Services, even if
they already provided the password in the Remote Desktop Connection client.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Users have the option to store both their username and password when they create a
new Remote Desktop Connection shortcut. If the server that runs Remote Desktop
Services allows users who have used this feature to log on to the server but not enter
their password, then it is possible that an attacker who has gained physical access to
the user's computer could connect to a Remote Desktop Server through the Remote
Desktop Connection shortcut, even though they may not know the user's password.

**Impact:**

Users cannot automatically log on to Remote Desktop Services by supplying their
passwords in the Remote Desktop Connection client. They will be prompted for a
password to log on.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to specify whether Remote Desktop Services requires
secure Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication with all clients or allows
unsecured communication.

You can use this policy setting to strengthen the security of RPC communication with
clients by allowing only authenticated and encrypted requests.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Allowing unsecure RPC communication can exposes the server to man in the middle
attacks and data disclosure attacks.

**Impact:**

Remote Desktop Services accepts requests from RPC clients that support secure
requests, and does not allow unsecured communication with untrusted clients.

**Audit:**

### 18.10.56.3.9.3 (L1) Ensure 'Require use of specific security layer for remote (RDP) connections' is set to 'Enabled: SSL' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether to require the use of a specific security layer to
secure communications between clients and RD Session Host servers during Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: SSL.

**Note: In spite of this setting being labeled SSL, it is actually enforcing Transport Layer**
Security (TLS) version 1.0, not the older (and less secure) SSL protocol.

**Rationale:**

The native Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) encryption is now considered a weak
protocol, so enforcing the use of stronger Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption for
all RDP communications between clients and RD Session Host servers is preferred.

**Impact:**

TLS 1.0 will be required to authenticate to the RD Session Host server. If TLS is not
supported, the connection fails.

**Note: By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If**
your organization has established the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for
SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the Server
_authentication certificate template setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your_
PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate template used for this purpose
must have “Client Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a
valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on
the workstation for it to work.

**Note #2: Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication**
Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will
expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP
logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that
Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is
present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial
connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double
logon” requirement for each and every new RDP session.

supported, it is used to authenticate the RD Session Host server. If TLS is not
supported, native RDP encryption is used, but the RD Session Host server is not
authenticated.)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to specify whether to require user authentication for
remote connections to the RD Session Host server by using Network Level
Authentication.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Requiring that user authentication occur earlier in the remote connection process
enhances security.

**Impact:**

Only client computers that support Network Level Authentication can connect to the RD
Session Host server.

**Note: Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication**
Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as Network Level Authentication will
expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP
logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that
Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is
present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial

### 18.10.56.3.9.5 (L1) Ensure 'Set client connection encryption level' is set to 'Enabled: High Level' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether to require the use of a specific encryption level to
secure communications between client computers and RD Session Host servers during
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. This policy only applies when you are
using native RDP encryption. However, native RDP encryption (as opposed to SSL
encryption) is not recommended. This policy does not apply to SSL encryption.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: High Level.

**Rationale:**

If Remote Desktop client connections that use low level encryption are allowed, it is
more likely that an attacker will be able to decrypt any captured Remote Desktop
Services network traffic.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 3.

### 18.10.56.3.10.1 (L2) Ensure 'Set time limit for active but idle Remote Desktop Services sessions' is set to 'Enabled: 15 minutes or less, but not Never (0)' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to specify the maximum amount of time that an active
Remote Desktop Services session can be idle (without user input) before it is
automatically disconnected.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 15 minutes or less, but not
```
Never (0).

```
**Rationale:**

This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the
computer for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from
being consumed by large numbers of inactive sessions. In addition, old, forgotten
Remote Desktop sessions that are still active can cause password lockouts if the user's
password has changed but the old session is still running. For systems that limit the
number of connected users (e.g. servers in the default Administrative mode - 2 sessions
only), other users' old but still active sessions can prevent another user from
connecting, resulting in an effective denial of service.

In addition, session timeouts that are misconfigured or set for a long period of time can
leave the system open to an attacker hijacking the session.

**Impact:**

Remote Desktop Services will automatically disconnect active but idle sessions after 15
minutes (or the specified amount of time). The user receives a warning two minutes
before the session disconnects, which allows the user to press a key or move the
mouse to keep the session active. Note that idle session time limits do not apply to
console sessions.

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to configure a time limit for disconnected Remote Desktop
Services sessions.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 1 minute.

**Rationale:**

This setting helps to prevent active Remote Desktop sessions from tying up the
computer for long periods of time while not in use, preventing computing resources from
being consumed by large numbers of disconnected but still active sessions. In addition,
old, forgotten Remote Desktop sessions that are still active can cause password
lockouts if the user's password has changed but the old session is still running. For
systems that limit the number of connected users (e.g. servers in the default
Administrative mode - 2 sessions only), other users' old but still active sessions can
prevent another user from connecting, resulting in an effective denial of service. This
setting is important to ensure a disconnected session is properly terminated.

In addition, session timeouts that are misconfigured or set for a long period of time can
leave the system open to an attacker hijacking the session.

**Impact:**

Disconnected Remote Desktop sessions are deleted from the server after 1 minute.
Note that disconnected session time limits do not apply to console sessions.

This policy setting determines whether or not the user can interact with Cortana using
speech while the system is locked.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

### 18.10.58.5 (L1) Ensure 'Allow indexing of encrypted files' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether encrypted items are allowed to be indexed. When
this setting is changed, the index is rebuilt completely. Full volume encryption (such as
BitLocker Drive Encryption or a non-Microsoft solution) must be used for the location of
the index to maintain security for encrypted files.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Indexing and allowing users to search encrypted files could potentially reveal
confidential data stored within the encrypted files.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 18.10.58.6 (L1) Ensure 'Allow search and Cortana to use location' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether search and Cortana can provide location aware
search and Cortana results.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

In an enterprise managed environment, allowing Cortana and Search to have access to
location data is unnecessary. Organizations likely do not want this information shared
out.

**Impact:**

Search and Cortana will not have access to location information.

**Description:**

This policy setting controls search highlights in the start menu search box and in search

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

In a high security environment, data should never be sent to or received by any thirdparty since this data could contain sensitive information.

### 18.10.62.1 (L2) Ensure 'Turn off KMS Client Online AVS Validation' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

The Key Management Service (KMS) is a Microsoft license activation method that
entails setting up a local server to store the software licenses. The KMS server itself
needs to connect to Microsoft to activate the KMS service, but subsequent on-network
clients can activate Microsoft Windows OS and/or their Microsoft Office via the KMS
server instead of connecting directly to Microsoft. This policy setting lets you opt-out of
sending KMS client activation data to Microsoft automatically.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Even though the KMS licensing method does not require KMS clients to connect to
Microsoft, they still send KMS client activation state data to Microsoft automatically.
Preventing this information from being sent can help reduce privacy concerns in high
security environments.

**Impact:**

The computer is prevented from sending data to Microsoft regarding its KMS client
activation state.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

### 18.10.65.1 (L2) Ensure 'Disable all apps from Microsoft Store' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This setting configures the launch of all apps from the Microsoft Store that came preinstalled or were downloaded.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: This policy setting only applies to Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10**
Education editions.

**Note #2: The name of this setting and the Enabled/Disabled values are incorrectly**
worded – logically, the title implies that configuring it to Enabled will disable all apps
from the Microsoft Store, and configuring it to Disabled will enable all apps from the
Microsoft Store. The opposite is true (and is consistent with the GPME help text). This is
a logical wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative Template.

**Rationale:**

The Store service is a retail outlet built into Windows, primarily for consumer use. In an
enterprise managed environment the IT department should be managing the installation
of all applications to reduce the risk of the installation of vulnerable software.

**Impact:**

All apps from the Microsoft Store that came pre-installed or were downloaded are
prevented from launching. Existing Microsoft Store apps will not be updated. Microsoft
Store is disabled.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting denies access to the retail catalog in the Microsoft Store, but displays
the private store.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Allowing the private store will allow an organization to control the apps that users have
access to add to a system. This will help ensure that unapproved malicious apps are not
running on a system.

### 18.10.75.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Notify Malicious' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether Enhanced Phishing Protection in Microsoft
Defender SmartScreen warns users if they type their work or school password into one
of the following malicious scenarios: into a reported phishing site, into a Microsoft login
URL with an invalid certificate, or into an application connecting to either a reported
phishing site or a Microsoft login URL with an invalid certificate.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This setting only applies to Microsoft Accounts (computer or browser login) while**
using Microsoft Windows 11 and not on-prem domain-joined accounts.

**Rationale:**

Users will receive a pop-up notification if they try to access a website that is being
blocked by Windows Defender SmartScreen. This assists users in making informed
decisions about why the website is being blocked and whether to continue to it.

**Impact:**

In some cases, Windows Defender SmartScreen may block legitimate websites, that
have been incorrectly flagged by Microsoft.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

### 18.10.75.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Notify Password Reuse' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether Enhanced Phishing Protection in Microsoft
Defender SmartScreen warns users if they reuse their work or school password.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This setting only applies to Microsoft Accounts (computer or browser login) while**
using Microsoft Windows 11 and not on prem domain-joined accounts.

**Rationale:**

Users will be alerted if they try to use a password that has been exposed in a known
data breach. This can help reduce the risk of password-related security incidents, such
as unauthorized access to online accounts, and can encourage users to choose strong
and unique passwords.

**Impact:**

Password reuse may be detected as a false positive by Microsoft.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WTDS\Components:NotifyPasswordReuse

### 18.10.75.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Notify Unsafe App' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether Enhanced Phishing Protection in Microsoft
Defender SmartScreen warns users if they type their work or school passwords in
Notepad, WordPad, or M365 Office apps like OneNote, Word, Excel, etc.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This setting only applies to Microsoft Accounts (computer or browser login) while**
using Microsoft Windows 11 and not on prem domain-joined accounts.

**Rationale:**

Users will be warned if they store their password in Notepad or Microsoft 365 Office
Apps. This can help reduce the risk of security incidents, such as data theft or data loss.
Storing credentials in plain text allows for anyone who has authorized or unauthorized
access to the system to obtain them.

**Impact:**

Saved passwords may be detected as false positives by Microsoft.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 18.10.75.1.5 (L1) Ensure 'Service Enabled' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether Enhanced Phishing Protection is in audit mode.
This allows notifications to be sent to users regarding unsafe password events.
Additionally, Enhanced Phishing Protection captures unsafe password entry events and
sends diagnostic data through Microsoft Defender.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: This setting only applies to Microsoft accounts (computer or browser login) while**
using Microsoft Windows 11 and not on-prem domain-joined accounts.

**Rationale:**

Allowing Enhanced Phishing Protection the ability to warn users about unsafe password
use could prevent phishing attempts and (credential) data loss. In addition, the Microsoft
365 Defender Portal provides valuable phishing sensor data found in the environment.

**Impact:**

None - this is default behavior.

### 18.10.75.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Configure Windows Defender SmartScreen' is set to 'Enabled: Warn and prevent bypass' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to manage the behavior of Windows Defender
SmartScreen. Windows Defender SmartScreen helps keep PCs safer by warning users
before running unrecognized programs downloaded from the Internet. Some information
is sent to Microsoft about files and programs run on PCs with this feature enabled.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Warn and prevent bypass.

**Rationale:**

Windows Defender SmartScreen helps keep PCs safer by warning users before running
unrecognized programs downloaded from the Internet. However, due to the fact that
some information is sent to Microsoft about files and programs run on PCs some
organizations may prefer to disable it.

**Impact:**

Users will be warned and prevented from running unrecognized programs downloaded
from the Internet.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry locations with a

**Description:**

This setting enables or disables the Windows Game Recording and Broadcasting
features.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

If this setting is allowed, users could record and broadcast session info to external sites,
which is both a risk of accidentally exposing sensitive company data (on-screen) outside
the company as well as a privacy concern.

#### 18.10.80 Windows Installer

This section contains recommendations related to Windows Installer.

This Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml that
is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.

Page 1197


-----

### 18.10.80.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow user control over installs' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting controls whether users are permitted to change installation options that
typically are available only to system administrators. The security features of Windows
Installer normally prevent users from changing installation options that are typically
reserved for system administrators, such as specifying the directory to which files are
installed. If Windows Installer detects that an installation package has permitted the
user to change a protected option, it stops the installation and displays a message.
These security features operate only when the installation program is running in a
privileged security context in which it has access to directories denied to the user.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

In an enterprise managed environment, only IT staff with administrative rights should be
installing or changing software on a system. Allowing users the ability to have any
control over installs can risk unapproved software from being installed or removed from
a system, which could cause the system to become vulnerable to compromise.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

```
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer:EnableUserControl

```

Page 1198


-----

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```
Disabled:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows
Components\Windows Installer\Allow user control over installs

```
**Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml**
that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.

**Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was named**
_Enable user control over installs, but it was renamed starting with the Windows 8.0 &_
Server 2012 (non-R2) Administrative Templates.

**Default Value:**

Disabled. (The security features of Windows Installer will prevent users from changing
installation options typically reserved for system administrators, such as specifying the
directory to which files are installed.)

### 18.10.80.2 (L1) Ensure 'Always install with elevated privileges' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions
when it installs any program on the system.

**Note: This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration**
folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.

**Caution: If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting**
grants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and
folders. Note that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be
secure.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer
installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in
Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators
group, installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

```
```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer:AlwaysInstallElevated

```

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```

```
**Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml**
that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.

Page 1200


-----

**Default Value:**

Disabled. (Windows Installer will apply the current user's permissions when it installs
programs that a system administrator does not distribute or offer. This will prevent
standard users from installing applications that affect system-wide configuration items.)

### 18.10.80.3 (L2) Ensure 'Prevent Internet Explorer security prompt for Windows Installer scripts' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether Web-based programs are allowed to install software
on the computer without notifying the user.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Suppressing the system warning can pose a security risk and increase the attack
surface on the system.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to

**Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially**
named Disable IE security prompt for Windows Installer scripts, but it was renamed
starting with the Windows 8.0 & Server 2012 (non-R2) Administrative Templates.

**Default Value:**

Disabled. (When a script hosted by an Internet browser tries to install a program on the
system, the system warns users and allows them to select or refuse the installation.)

### 18.10.81.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enable MPR notifications for the system' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether winlogon sends Multiple Provider Router (MPR)
notifications. MPR handles communication between the Windows operating system and
the installed network providers. MPR checks the registry to determine which providers
are installed on the system and the order they are cycled through.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

MPR is a legacy utility that provides notifications to registered credential managers or
network providers when there is a logon event or a password change event. Although
this functionality can be used by legitimate applications, it can also be abused by
attackers to harvest logon information.

**Impact:**
```
Winlogon will not send Multiple Provider Router (MPR) notifications on the system.

```
**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```

### 18.10.81.2 (L1) Ensure 'Sign-in and lock last interactive user automatically after a restart' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether a device will automatically sign-in the last interactive
user after Windows Update restarts the system.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Disabling this feature will prevent the caching of user's credentials and unauthorized
use of the device, and also ensure the user is aware of the restart.

**Impact:**

The device does not store the user's credentials for automatic sign-in after a Windows
Update restart. The users' lock screen apps are not restarted after the system restarts.
The user is required to present the logon credentials in order to proceed after restart.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System:DisableAutomat

```
**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```
Disabled:

Components\Windows Logon Options\Sign-in and lock last interactive user
automatically after a restart

```
**Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template**

**Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially**
named Sign-in last interactive user automatically after a system-initiated restart, but it
was renamed starting with the Windows 10 Release 1903 Administrative Templates.

Page 1207


-----

**Default Value:**

Enabled. (The device securely saves the user's credentials (including the user name,
domain and encrypted password) to configure automatic sign-in after a Windows
Update restart. After the Windows Update restart, the user is automatically signed-in
and the session is automatically locked with all the lock screen apps configured for that
user.)

### 18.10.86.1 (L2) Ensure 'Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting enables logging of all PowerShell script input to the Applications
```
and Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Operational Event Log channel.

```
The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: If logging of Script Block Invocation Start/Stop Events is enabled (option box**
checked), PowerShell will log additional events when invocation of a command, script
block, function, or script starts or stops. Enabling this option generates a high volume of
event logs. CIS has intentionally chosen not to make a recommendation for this option,
since it generates a large volume of events. If an organization chooses to enable the
**optional setting (checked), this also conforms to the benchmark.**

**Rationale:**

Logs of PowerShell script input can be very valuable when performing forensic
investigations of PowerShell attack incidents to determine what occurred.

**Impact:**

PowerShell script input will be logged to the Applications and Services
```
Logs\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Operational Event Log channel, which can

```
contain credentials and sensitive information.

**Note: Configuring this setting to Enabled generates a high volume of event logs which**
will be overwritten if the log size is not expanded or offloaded to a log collection system.

**Warning: There are potential risks of capturing credentials and sensitive information in**
the PowerShell logs, which could be exposed to users who have read-access to those
logs. Microsoft provides a feature called "Protected Event Logging" to better secure
[event log data. For assistance with protecting event logging, visit: About Logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_logging_windows?view=powershell-7.2#protected-event-logging)

### 18.10.86.2 (L2) Ensure 'Turn on PowerShell Transcription' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This Policy setting lets you capture the input and output of Windows PowerShell
commands into text-based transcripts.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

PowerShell transcript input can be very valuable when performing forensic
investigations of PowerShell attack incidents to determine what occurred.

**Impact:**

PowerShell transcript input will be logged to PowerShell_transcript output files, which
are saved to the My Documents folder (within a separate subfolder for each day) of
each users´ profile by default. Optionally, a specific output directory name can be
specified, which will contain all PowerShell transcript logs in a subfolder of My
Documents. If specifying a full path outside the users My Documents folder, other users
on the system could have access to view these logs, which may contain sensitive
information such as passwords.

**Warning: There are potential risks of capturing credentials and sensitive information in**
```
PowerShell_transcript output files, which could be exposed to users who have read

```
access to the files.

**Warning #2: PowerShell Transcription is not compatible with the natively installed**
PowerShell v4 on Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1511 and Server 2012 R2 and below.
If this recommendation is set as prescribed, PowerShell will need to be updated to at
[least v5.1 or newer. For more information on updating PowerShell, please see Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/install/windows-powershell-system-requirements?view=powershell-7.3#operating-system-requirements)

### 18.10.88.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow Basic authentication' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management
(WinRM) client uses Basic authentication.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Basic authentication is less robust than other authentication methods available in
WinRM because credentials including passwords are transmitted in plain text. An
attacker who is able to capture packets on the network where WinRM is running may be
able to determine the credentials used for accessing remote hosts via WinRM.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management
(WinRM) service automatically listens on the network for requests on the HTTP
transport over the default HTTP port.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Any feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network

### 18.10.88.2.4 (L1) Ensure 'Disallow WinRM from storing RunAs credentials' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to manage whether the Windows Remote Management
(WinRM) service will allow RunAs credentials to be stored for any plug-ins.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: If you enable and then disable this policy setting, any values that were previously**
configured for RunAsPassword will need to be reset.

**Rationale:**

Although the ability to store RunAs credentials is a convenient feature it increases the
risk of account compromise slightly. For example, if you forget to lock your desktop
before leaving it unattended for a few minutes another person could access not only the
desktop of your computer but also any hosts you manage via WinRM with cached
RunAs credentials.

**Impact:**

The WinRM service will not allow the RunAsUser or RunAsPassword configuration values
to be set for any plug-ins. If a plug-in has already set the RunAsUser and RunAsPassword
configuration values, the RunAsPassword configuration value will be erased from the
credential store on the computer.

If this setting is later Disabled again, any values that were previously configured for
```
RunAsPassword will need to be reset.

```

### 18.10.89.1 (L2) Ensure 'Allow Remote Shell Access' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to manage configuration of remote access to all supported
shells to execute scripts and commands.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: The GPME help text for this setting is incorrectly worded, implying that**
configuring it to Enabled will reject new Remote Shell connections, and setting it to
```
Disabled will allow Remote Shell connections. The opposite is true (and is consistent

```
with the title of the setting). This is a wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative
Template.

**Rationale:**

Any feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network
connections are particularly risky. Only enable the use of the Windows Remote Shell on
trusted networks and when feasible employ additional controls such as IPsec.

**Impact:**

New Remote Shell connections are not allowed and are rejected by the workstation.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Service\WinRS:AllowRemoteShell
Access

```
**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```

### 18.10.90.1 (L1) Ensure 'Allow clipboard sharing with Windows Sandbox' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting enables or disables clipboard sharing with the Windows Sandbox.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: The Windows Sandbox feature was first introduced in Windows 10 R1903, and**
allows a temporary "clean install" virtual instance of Windows to be run inside the host,
for the ostensible purpose of testing applications without making changes to the host.

**Rationale:**

Disabling copy and paste decreases the attack surface exposed by the Windows
Sandbox and possible exposure of untrusted applications to the internal network.

**Impact:**

The copy and paste function to/from the Windows Sandbox will be disabled. Therefore,
files will not be able to be moved to/from the Windows Sandbox via the clipboard.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 18.10.90.2 (L1) Ensure 'Allow networking in Windows Sandbox' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting enables or disables networking in the Windows Sandbox. Networking
is achieved by creating a virtual switch on the host, and connecting the Windows
Sandbox to it via a virtual Network Interface Card (NIC).

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: The Windows Sandbox feature was first introduced in Windows 10 R1903, and**
allows a temporary "clean install" virtual instance of Windows to be run inside the host,
for the ostensible purpose of testing applications without making changes to the host.

**Rationale:**

Disabling network access decreases the attack surface exposed by the Windows
Sandbox and exposure of untrusted applications to the internal network.

**Note: Per Microsoft, enabling networking in the Windows Sandbox can expose**
untrusted applications to the internal network.

**Impact:**

Network access to/from the Windows Sandbox will be disabled. Therefore, files will not
be able to be moved to/from the Windows Sandbox via the network.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a

### 18.10.92.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'No auto-restart with logged on users for scheduled automatic updates installations' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies that Automatic Updates will wait for computers to be
restarted by the users who are logged on to them to complete a scheduled installation.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: This setting applies only when you configure Automatic Updates to perform**
scheduled update installations. If you configure the Configure Automatic Updates
setting to Disabled, this setting has no effect.

**Rationale:**

Some security updates require that the computer be restarted to complete an
installation. If the computer cannot restart automatically, then the most recent update
will not completely install and no new updates will download to the computer until it is
restarted. Without the auto-restart functionality, users who are not security-conscious
may choose to indefinitely delay the restart, therefore keeping the computer in a less
secure state.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.

### 18.10.92.2.1 (L1) Ensure 'Configure Automatic Updates' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies whether computers in your environment will receive security
updates from Windows Update or WSUS. If you configure this policy setting to Enabled,
the operating system will recognize when a network connection is available and then
use the network connection to search Windows Update or your designated intranet site
for updates that apply to them.

After you configure this policy setting to Enabled, select one of the following three
options in the Configure Automatic Updates Properties dialog box to specify how the
service will work:

  - 2 - Notify for download and auto install (Notify before downloading any updates)

  - 3 - Auto download and notify for install (Download the updates automatically and
_notify when they are ready to be installed.) (Default setting)_

  - 4 - Auto download and schedule the install (Automatically download updates and
_install them on the schedule specified below.))_

  - 5 - Allow local admin to choose setting (Leave decision on above choices up to
_the local Administrators (Not Recommended))_

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: The sub-setting "Configure automatic updating:" has 4 possible values – all of**
them are valid depending on specific organizational needs, however if feasible we
suggest using a value of 4 - Auto download and schedule the install. This
suggestion is not a scored requirement.

**Note #2: Organizations that utilize a third--party solution for patching may choose to**
exempt themselves from this recommendation, and instead configure it to Disabled so
that the native Windows Update mechanism does not interfere with the third--party
patching process.

**Rationale:**

Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that
problems will be discovered after the products are shipped. The Configure Automatic
Updates setting can help you ensure that the computers in your environment will always
have the most recent critical operating system updates and service packs installed.

**Impact:**

Critical operating system updates and service packs will be installed as necessary.

**Description:**

This policy setting specifies when computers in your environment will receive security
updates from Windows Update or WSUS.

The recommended state for this setting is: 0 - Every day.

**Note: This setting is only applicable if 4 - Auto download and schedule the install is**
selected in the recommendation 'Configure Automatic Updates'. It will have no impact if
any other option is selected.

**Rationale:**

Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that
problems will be discovered after the products are shipped. The Configure Automatic
Updates setting can help you ensure that the computers in your environment will always
have the most recent critical operating system updates and service packs installed.

**Impact:**

If 4 - Auto download and schedule the install is selected in recommendation
_'Configure Automatic Updates', critical operating system updates and service packs will_
automatically download every day (at 3:00 A.M., by default).

**Beta Channel: Ideal for feature explorers who want to see upcoming Windows 10**
features. Your feedback will be especially important here as it will help our engineers
ensure key issues are fixed before a major release.

**Release Preview Channel (default): Insiders in the Release Preview Channel will**
have access to the upcoming release of Windows 10 prior to it being released to the
world. These builds are supported by Microsoft. The Release Preview Channel is where
we recommend companies preview and validate upcoming Windows 10 releases before
broad deployment within their organization.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: Preview Build enrollment requires a telemetry level setting of 2 or higher and your**
domain registered on insider.windows.com. For additional information on Preview
Builds, see: [https://aka.ms/wipforbiz](https://aka.ms/wipforbiz)

**Rationale:**

It can be risky for experimental features to be allowed in an enterprise managed
environment because this can introduce bugs and security holes into systems, making it
easier for an attacker to gain access. It is generally preferred to only use productionready builds.

**Impact:**

Preview builds are prevented from installing on the device.

### 18.10.92.4.2 (L1) Ensure 'Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received' is set to 'Enabled: 180 or more days' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines when Preview Build or Feature Updates are received.

**Defer Updates This enables devices to defer taking the next Feature Update available**
to your channel for up to 14 days for all the pre-release channels and up to 365 days for
the Semi-Annual Channel. Or, if the device is updating from the Semi-Annual Channel,
a version for the device to move to and/or stay on until the policy is updated or the
device reaches end of service can be specified. Note: If you set both policies, the
version specified will take precedence and the deferrals will not be in effect. Please see
the Windows Release Information page for OS version information.

**Pause Updates To prevent Feature Updates from being received on their scheduled**
time, you can temporarily pause Feature Updates. The pause will remain in effect for 35
days from the specified start date or until the field is cleared (Quality Updates will still be
offered).

**Note: If the "Allow Diagnostic Data" (formerly "Allow Telemetry") policy is set to 0, this**
policy will have no effect.

**Note #2: Starting with Windows 10 R1607, Microsoft introduced a new Windows**
Update (WU) client behavior called Dual Scan, with an eye to cloud-based update
management. In some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows
Updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If
you are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting to Not
`Configured` _or configure the setting Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans_
_against Windows Update (added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative_
Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. More information
on Dual Scan is available at these links:

  - [Demystifying “Dual Scan” – WSUS Product Team Blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/wsus/2017/05/05/demystifying-dual-scan/)

  - Improving Dual Scan on 1607 – WSUS Product Team Blog

**Note #3: Prior to Windows 10 R1703, values above 180 days are not recognized by the**
OS. Starting with Windows 10 R1703, the maximum number of days you can defer is
365 days.

Page 1256


-----

**Rationale:**

In a production environment, it is preferred to only use software and features that are
publicly available, after they have gone through rigorous testing in beta.

**Impact:**

Feature Updates will be delayed until they are publicly released to general public by
Microsoft.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1 (DeferFeatureUpdates) and 180

**Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially**
named Select when Feature Updates are received, but it was renamed to Select when
_Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received starting with the Windows 10 Release_
1709 Administrative Templates.

**Default Value:**

Disabled. (Feature Update cadence will not be enforced by Group Policy.)

**Rationale:**

Quality Updates can contain important bug fixes and/or security patches, and should be
installed as soon as possible.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

### 18.10.92.4.4 (L1) Ensure 'Enable optional updates' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting controls whether devices are able to receive optional updates
(including Controlled Feature Rollout (CFRs)). These optional updates can include nonsecurity updates, feature enhancements, and other improvements.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Often, new features or enhancements that are enabled by default (before IT
administrators are ready to manage them) can negatively impact the user experience or
introduce bugs and security risks.

**Impact:**

New features will not be available on the system until the feature update that includes
these features and enhancements is installed.

### 19.7.5.1 (L1) Ensure 'Do not preserve zone information in file attachments' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting allows you to manage whether Windows marks file attachments with
information about their zone of origin (such as restricted, Internet, intranet, local). This
requires NTFS in order to function correctly, and will fail without notice on FAT32. By
not preserving the zone information, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note: The Attachment Manager feature warns users when opening or executing files**
which are marked as being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's zone
information has been removed via the "Unblock" button on the file's properties or via a
separate tool such as [Microsoft Sysinternals Streams.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/streams)

**Rationale:**

A file that is downloaded from a computer in the Internet or Restricted Sites zone may
be moved to a location that makes it appear safe, like an intranet file share, and
executed by an unsuspecting user. The Attachment Manager feature will warn users
when opening or executing files which are marked as being from an untrusted source,
unless/until the file's zone information has been removed.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as

### 19.7.5.2 (L1) Ensure 'Notify antivirus programs when opening attachments' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting manages the behavior for notifying registered antivirus programs. If
multiple programs are registered, they will all be notified.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Note: An updated antivirus program must be installed for this policy setting to function**
properly.

**Rationale:**

Antivirus programs that do not perform on-access checks may not be able to scan
downloaded files.

**Impact:**

Windows tells the registered antivirus program(s) to scan the file when a user opens a
file attachment. If the antivirus program fails, the attachment is blocked from being
opened.

### 19.7.8.1 (L1) Ensure 'Configure Windows spotlight on lock screen' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting lets you configure Windows Spotlight on the lock screen.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Note:** [Per Microsoft TechNet, this policy setting only applies to Windows 10 Enterprise](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/manage/group-policies-for-enterprise-and-education-editions)
and Windows 10 Education editions.

**Rationale:**

Enabling this setting will help ensure your data is not shared with any third party. The
Windows Spotlight feature collects data and uses that data to display suggested apps
as well as images from the internet.

**Impact:**

Windows Spotlight will be turned off and users will no longer be able to select it as their
lock screen.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 2.

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether Windows will suggest apps and content from
third-party software publishers.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Enabling this setting will help ensure your data is not shared with any third party. The
Windows Spotlight feature collects data and uses that data to display suggested apps
as well as images from the internet.

**Impact:**

Windows Spotlight on lock screen, Windows tips, Microsoft consumer features and
other related features will no longer suggest apps and content from third-party software
publishers. Users may still see suggestions and tips to make them more productive with
Microsoft features and apps.

### 19.7.8.3 (L2) Ensure 'Do not use diagnostic data for tailored experiences' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This setting determines if Windows can use diagnostic data to provide tailored
experiences to the user.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Tracking, collection and utilization of personalized data is a privacy and security issue
that is of concern to many organizations.

**Impact:**

Windows will not use diagnostic data from this device (this data may include browser,
app and feature usage, depending on the "Diagnostic and usage data" setting value) to
customize content shown on the lock screen, Windows tips, Microsoft consumer
features and other related features. If these features are enabled, users will still see
recommendations, tips and offers, but they may be less personalized.

### 19.7.8.5 (L1) Ensure 'Turn off Spotlight collection on Desktop' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting removes the Spotlight collection setting in Personalization, rendering
the user unable to select and subsequently download daily images from Microsoft to the
system desktop.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

Enabling this setting will help ensure your data is not shared with any third party. The
Windows Spotlight feature collects data and uses that data to display images from
Microsoft.

**Impact:**

The Spotlight collection feature will not be available as an option in Personalization
settings, so users will not be able to download daily images from Microsoft.

### 19.7.26.1 (L1) Ensure 'Prevent users from sharing files within their profile.' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This policy setting determines whether users can share files within their profile. By
default, users are allowed to share files within their profile to other users on their
network after an administrator opts in the computer. An administrator can opt in the
computer by using the sharing wizard to share a file within their profile.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

If not properly configured, a user could accidentally share sensitive data with
unauthorized users. In an enterprise managed environment, the company should
provide a managed location for file sharing, such as a file server or SharePoint, instead
of the user sharing files directly from their own user profile.

**Impact:**

Users cannot share files within their profile using the sharing wizard. Also, the sharing
wizard cannot create a share at %root%\Users and can only be used to create SMB
shares on folders.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.

**Description:**

This policy setting configures the use of Windows Copilot. Windows Copilot is an
artificial intelligence (AI) assistant that's integrated in Microsoft Windows workstation
OSes, beginning with Windows 11 Release 23H2.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

While AI can be an exciting new technology, it also carries its own risks, including the
possibility of users accidentally uploading or typing personal or organization-sensitive
data into it, with no real way to “undo” or get that data back.

**Impact:**

Users will not be able to use Windows Copilot and its icon will not appear on the
taskbar.

### 19.7.42.1 (L1) Ensure 'Always install with elevated privileges' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 1 (L1) - Corporate/Enterprise Environment (general use)

**Description:**

This setting controls whether or not Windows Installer should use system permissions
when it installs any program on the system.

**Note: This setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration**
folders. To make this setting effective, you must enable the setting in both folders.

**Caution: If enabled, skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this setting**
grants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and
folders. Note that the User Configuration version of this setting is not guaranteed to be
secure.

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

**Rationale:**

Users with limited privileges can exploit this feature by creating a Windows Installer
installation package that creates a new local account that belongs to the local built-in
Administrators group, adds their current account to the local built-in Administrators
group, installs malicious software, or performs other unauthorized activities.

**Impact:**

None - this is the default behavior.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 0.
HKU\[USER
SID]\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer:AlwaysInstallElevated

```
**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```
Disabled:
User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows
Components\Windows Installer\Always install with elevated privileges

```
**Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template MSI.admx/adml**
that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates.

Page 1300


-----

**Default Value:**

Disabled. (Windows Installer will apply the current user's permissions when it installs
programs that a system administrator does not distribute or offer. This will prevent
standard users from installing applications that affect system-wide configuration items.)

### 19.7.44.2.1 (L2) Ensure 'Prevent Codec Download' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated)

**Profile Applicability:**

- Level 2 (L2) - High Security/Sensitive Data Environment (limited functionality)

**Description:**

This setting controls whether Windows Media Player is allowed to download additional
codecs for decoding media files it does not already understand.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

**Rationale:**

This has some potential for risk if a malicious data file is opened in Media Player that
requires an additional codec to be installed. If a special codec is required for a
necessary job function, then that codec should first be tested to ensure it is legitimate,
and it should be supplied by the IT department in the organization.

**Impact:**

Windows Media Player is prevented from automatically downloading codecs to your
computer. In addition, the Download codecs automatically check box on the Player tab
in the Player is not available.

**Audit:**

Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as
prescribed. This group policy setting is backed by the following registry location with a
```
REG_DWORD value of 1.
HKU\[USER
SID]\Software\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsMediaPlayer:PreventCodecDownload

```
**Remediation:**

To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to
```
Enabled:
User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows
Components\Windows Media Player\Playback\Prevent Codec Download

```
**Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template**
```
WindowsMediaPlayer.admx/adml that is included with all versions of the Microsoft

```
Windows Administrative Templates.

**Default Value:**

Users can change the setting for the Download codecs automatically check box.
