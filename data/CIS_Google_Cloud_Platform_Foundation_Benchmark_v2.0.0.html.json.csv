Application/VM-Instance uses the service account to call the service's Google API so that users aren't directly involved.
In addition to being an identity, a service account is a resource that has IAM policies attached to it. These policies determine who can use the service account.
Users with IAM roles to update the App Engine and Compute Engine instances (such as App Engine Deployer or Compute Instance Admin) can effectively run code as the service accounts used to run these instances, and indirectly gain access to all the resources for which the service accounts have access. Similarly, SSH access to a Compute Engine instance may also provide the ability to execute code as that instance/Service account.
Based on business needs, there could be multiple user-managed service accounts configured for a project. Granting the iam.serviceAccountUser or iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator roles to a user for a project gives the user access to all service accounts in the project, including service accounts that may be created in the future. This can result in elevation of privileges by using service accounts and corresponding Compute Engine instances.
In order to implement least privileges best practices, IAM users should not be assigned the Service Account User or Service Account Token Creator roles at the project level. Instead, these roles should be assigned to a user for a specific service account, giving that user access to the service account. The Service Account User allows a user to bind a service account to a long-running job service, whereas the Service Account Token Creator role allows a user to directly impersonate (or assert) the identity of a service account.","After revoking Service Account User or  Service Account Token Creator roles at the project level from all impacted user account(s), these roles should be assigned to a user(s) for specific service account(s) according to business needs.","From Google Cloud Console

There will be subscription costs associated with these support levels, as well as increased storage costs for storing the logs. You will also not be able to turn the Access Transparency which Access Approval depends on, off yourself. To do so you will need to submit a service request to Google Cloud Support. There will also be additional overhead in managing user permissions.

Cloud Storage offers two systems for granting users permission to access your buckets and objects: Cloud Identity and Access Management (Cloud IAM) and Access Control Lists (ACLs). These systems act in parallel - in order for a user to access a Cloud Storage resource, only one of the systems needs to grant the user permission. Cloud IAM is used throughout Google Cloud and allows you to grant a variety of permissions at the bucket and project levels. ACLs are used only by Cloud Storage and have limited permission options, but they allow you to grant permissions on a per-object basis.
In order to support a uniform permissioning system, Cloud Storage has uniform bucket-level access. Using this feature disables ACLs for all Cloud Storage resources: access to Cloud Storage resources then is granted exclusively through Cloud IAM. Enabling uniform bucket-level access guarantees that if a Storage bucket is not publicly accessible, no object in the bucket is publicly accessible either.","If you enable uniform bucket-level access, you revoke access from users who gain their access solely through object ACLs.

When Flow Logs are enabled for a subnet, VMs within that subnet start reporting on all Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows.
Each VM samples the TCP and UDP flows it sees, inbound and outbound, whether the flow is to or from another VM, a host in the on-premises datacenter, a Google service, or a host on the Internet.

Admin Activity logs contain log entries for API calls or other administrative actions that modify the configuration or metadata of resources. Admin Activity audit logs are enabled for all services and cannot be configured.


Data Access audit logs record API calls that create, modify, or read user-provided data. These are disabled by default and should be enabled.
There are three kinds of Data Access audit log information:

Admin read: Records operations that read metadata or configuration information. Admin Activity audit logs record writes of metadata and configuration information that cannot be disabled.
Data read: Records operations that read user-provided data.
Data write: Records operations that write user-provided data.



It is recommended to have an effective default audit config configured in such a way that:


logtype is set to DATA_READ (to log user activity tracking) and DATA_WRITES (to log changes/tampering to user data).


audit config is enabled for all the services supported by the Data Access audit logs feature.

Once a flow log is created, the user can view and retrieve its data in Stackdriver Logging. It is recommended that Flow Logs be enabled for every business-critical VPC subnet.","VPC networks and subnetworks not reserved for internal HTTP(S) load balancing provide logically isolated and secure network partitions where GCP resources can be launched. When Flow Logs are enabled for a subnet, VMs within that subnet start reporting on all Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows.
Each VM samples the TCP and UDP flows it sees, inbound and outbound, whether the flow is to or from another VM, a host in the on-premises datacenter, a Google service, or a host on the Internet. If two GCP VMs are communicating, and both are in subnets that have VPC Flow Logs enabled, both VMs report the flows.
Flow Logs supports the following use cases:

Network monitoring
Understanding network usage and optimizing network traffic expenses
Network forensics
Real-time security analysis

Flow Logs provide visibility into network traffic for each VM inside the subnet and can be used to detect anomalous traffic or provide insight during security workflows.
The Flow Logs must be configured such that all network traffic is logged, the interval of logging is granular to provide detailed information on the connections, no logs are filtered, and metadata to facilitate investigations are included.
Note: Subnets reserved for use by internal HTTP(S) load balancers do not support VPC flow logs.","Standard pricing for Stackdriver Logging, BigQuery, or Cloud Pub/Sub applies.
