Binary Authorization requires images to be signed by trusted authorities during the development process. These signatures are then validated at deployment time. By enforcing validation, tighter control over the container environment can be gained by ensuring only verified images are integrated into the build-and-release process.","Care must be taken when defining policy in order to prevent inadvertent denial of container image deployments. Depending on policy, attestations for existing container images running within the cluster may need to be created before those images are redeployed or pulled as part of the pod churn.
To prevent key system images from being denied deployment, consider the use of global policy evaluation mode, which uses a global policy provided by Google and exempts a list of Google-provided system images from further policy evaluation.","Using Google Cloud Console:

With COS, the containers can be brought up on Google Cloud Platform quickly, efficiently, and securely.
Using COS as the node image provides the following benefits:

Run containers out of the box: COS instances come pre-installed with the container runtime and cloud-init. With a COS instance, the container can be brought up at the same time as the VM is created, with no on-host setup required.
Smaller attack surface: COS has a smaller footprint, reducing the instance's potential attack surface.
Locked-down by default: COS instances include a locked-down firewall and other security settings by default.","If modifying an existing cluster's Node pool to run COS, the upgrade operation used is long-running and will block other operations on the cluster (including delete) until it has run to completion.
COS nodes also provide an option with containerd as the main container runtime directly integrated with Kubernetes instead of docker.

Kubernetes Engine uses both Transport Layer Security (TLS) and authentication to provide secure access to your cluster's control plane from the public internet. This provides you the flexibility to administer your cluster from anywhere; however, you might want to further restrict access to a set of IP addresses that you control. You can set this restriction by specifying an authorized network.
Control Plane Authorized Networks blocks untrusted IP addresses. Google Cloud Platform IPs (such as traffic from Compute Engine VMs) can reach your master through HTTPS provided that they have the necessary Kubernetes credentials.
Restricting access to an authorized network can provide additional security benefits for your container cluster, including:

Better protection from outsider attacks: Authorized networks provide an additional layer of security by limiting external, non-GCP access to a specific set of addresses you designate, such as those that originate from your premises. This helps protect access to your cluster in the case of a vulnerability in the cluster's authentication or authorization mechanism.
Better protection from insider attacks: Authorized networks help protect your cluster from accidental leaks of master certificates from your company's premises. Leaked certificates used from outside GCP and outside the authorized IP ranges (for example, from addresses outside your company) are still denied access.","When implementing Control Plane Authorized Networks, be careful to ensure all desired networks are on the allowlist to prevent inadvertently blocking external access to your cluster's control plane.","Using Google Cloud Console:

These connections terminate at the kubelet?fs HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet?fs serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests.","You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.","Audit Method 1:
Kubelets can accept configuration via a configuration file and in some cases via command line arguments. It is important to note that parameters provided as command line arguments will override their counterpart parameters in the configuration file (see --config details in the Kubelet CLI Reference for more info, where you can also find out which configuration parameters can be supplied as a command line argument).
With this in mind, it is important to check for the existence of command line arguments as well as configuration file entries when auditing Kubelet configuration.
Firstly, SSH to each node and execute the following command to find the Kubelet process:
ps -ef | grep kubelet

The output of the above command provides details of the active Kubelet process, from which we can see the command line arguments provided to the process. Also note the location of the configuration file, provided with the --config argument, as this will be needed to verify configuration. The file can be viewed with a command such as more or less, like so:
sudo less /path/to/kubelet-config.json

Verify that a client certificate authority file is configured. This may be configured using a command line argument to the kubelet service with --client-ca-file or in the kubelet configuration file via ""authentication"": { ""x509"": {""clientCAFile"": <path/to/client-ca-file> } }"".
Audit Method 2:
It is also possible to review the running configuration of a Kubelet via the /configz endpoint of the Kubernetes API. This can be achieved using kubectl to proxy your requests to the API.
Discover all nodes in your cluster by running the following command:
kubectl get nodes

Next, initiate a proxy with kubectl on a local port of your choice. In this example we will use 8080:
kubectl proxy --port=8080

With this running, in a separate terminal run the following command for each node:
export NODE_NAME=my-node-name
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/nodes/${NODE_NAME}/proxy/configz    

The curl command will return the API response which will be a JSON formatted string representing the Kubelet configuration.
Verify that a client certificate authority file is configured with ""authentication"": { ""x509"": {""clientCAFile"": <path/to/client-ca-file> } }"" in the API response.","Remediation Method 1:
If configuring via the Kubelet config file, you first need to locate the file.
To do this, SSH to each node and execute the following command to find the kubelet process:
ps -ef | grep kubelet

The output of the above command provides details of the active kubelet process, from which we can see the location of the configuration file provided to the kubelet service with the --config argument. The file can be viewed with a command such as more or less, like so:
sudo less /path/to/kubelet-config.json

Configure the client certificate authority file by setting the following parameter appropriately:
""authentication"": { ""x509"": {""clientCAFile"": <path/to/client-ca-file> } }""

Remediation Method 2:
If using executable arguments, edit the kubelet service file on each worker node and ensure the below parameters are part of the KUBELET_ARGS variable string.
For systems using systemd, such as the Amazon EKS Optimised Amazon Linux or Bottlerocket AMIs, then this file can be found at /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubelet-args.conf. Otherwise, you may need to look up documentation for your chosen operating system to determine which service manager is configured:
--client-ca-file=<path/to/client-ca-file>

For Both Remediation Steps:
Based on your system, restart the kubelet service and check the service status.
The following example is for operating systems using systemd, such as the Amazon EKS Optimised Amazon Linux or Bottlerocket AMIs, and invokes the systemctl command. If systemctl is not available then you will need to look up documentation for your chosen operating system to determine which service manager is configured:

When Client Certificate authentication is disabled, you will still be able to authenticate to the cluster with other authentication methods, such as OpenID Connect tokens. See also Recommendation 6.8.1 to disable authentication using static passwords, known as Basic Authentication.","Users will no longer be able to authenticate with the pre-provisioned x509 certificate. You will have to configure and use alternate authentication mechanisms, such as OpenID Connect tokens.","The audit script for this recommendation utilizes 3 variables:
$CLUSTER_NAME
$COMPUTE_ZONE
Please set these parameters on the system where you will be executing your gcloud audit script or command.
Using Google Cloud Console

Go to Kubernetes Engine by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list
From the list of clusters, click on the desired cluster. On the Details pane, make sure 'Client certificate' is set to 'Disabled'.

Using Command line
To check that the client certificate has not been issued, run the following command:
gcloud container clusters describe $CLUSTER_NAME \
  --zone $COMPUTE_ZONE \
  --format json | jq '.masterAuth.clientKey'

The output of the above command returns null ({ }) if the client certificate has not been issued for the cluster (Client Certificate authentication is disabled).
Note.  Depreciated as of v1.19. For Basic Authentication, Legacy authorization can be edited for standard clusters but cannot be edited in Autopilot clusters.","Currently, there is no way to remove a client certificate from an existing cluster. Thus a new cluster must be created.

When you enable GKE Sandbox on a Node pool, a sandbox is created for each Pod running on a node in that Node pool. In addition, nodes running sandboxed Pods are prevented from accessing other GCP services or cluster metadata. Each sandbox uses its own userspace kernel.
Multi-tenant clusters and clusters whose containers run untrusted workloads are more exposed to security vulnerabilities than other clusters. Examples include SaaS providers, web-hosting providers, or other organizations that allow their users to upload and run code. A flaw in the container runtime or in the host kernel could allow a process running within a container to 'escape' the container and affect the node's kernel, potentially bringing down the node.
The potential also exists for a malicious tenant to gain access to and exfiltrate another tenant's data in memory or on disk, by exploiting such a defect.","Using GKE Sandbox requires the node image to be set to Container-Optimized OS with containerd (cos_containerd).
It is not currently possible to use GKE Sandbox along with the following Kubernetes features:

Accelerators such as GPUs or TPUs
Istio
Monitoring statistics at the level of the Pod or container
Hostpath storage
